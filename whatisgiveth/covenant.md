title: Giveth Community Covenant
---

The Giveth DAO is a self governed organization dedicated to revolutionizing philanthropy and "Building the Future of Giving" by bridging the Ethereum and non-profit worlds. Giveth's mission is to build a culture of giving that empowers and rewards those who give - to projects, to society, and to the world.

Giveth envisions a future in which giving is effortless and people all around the world are rewarded for creating positive change. The Giveth platforms aim to be free for donors and projects, globally accesible and self-sustaining. Giveth aims to facilitate the efficient, transparent flow of funds directly to where they have the most positive impact.

The Giveth community [values](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/) decentralization, innovation, altruism, empowerment, trust, transparency and collaboration. This social layer is the foundation on which our DAO is built.

The GIVeconomy represents the economic layer where GIV is issued and distributed programmatically. GIV tokens will be allocated to fund proposals passed in the GIVgarden. GIV distribution from the GIVgarden is henceforth determined by the community who is empowered to use their GIV to vote.

The growth of Giveth is directly related to the community's ability to foster an inclusive and welcoming culture that people feel proud and delighted to adopt as their own. When someone chooses participate in the Giveth community, they are implicitly supporting the community's culture, values and norms.

Therefore, Giveth rests on an ever-evolving social contract, which sets expectations for how members should engage both with the protocol and with one another.  This Covenant attempts to lay out this social contract. Organizationally, the Covenant first lays out our pledge to each other to make the Giveth community a welcoming environment for everybody.  Second, the Covenant discusses the way both off-chain and on-chain decisions are made and how those decisions are judged to be successful.  As a community driven DAO, the Covenant is subject to change via the community.  

## The Pledge
We as members, contributors and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body shape, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that are in agreement with the [Giveth mission, vision and values](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/), and contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

### Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: 
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people 
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences 
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback 
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, while learning from the experience 
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include: 
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind 
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks 
- Public or private harassment 
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (commonly called doxing)
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## On-chain

### Decision Making

Giveth uses the [Gardens](https://1hive.gitbook.io/gardens/) governance platform to manage the DAO configurations and allocate funds to projects that are aligned with its [mission, vision and values](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/). 

On-chain decision making mechanisms include [Conviction Voting](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/conviction-voting-tl-dr/308?u=liviade) and [Tao Voting](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/tao-voting-formerly-disputable-voting-parameters-general-discussion/267). Conviction Voting should be used primarily for funds allocation. Tao Voting should be used for updating parameters, bug fixes, adding new features to the DAO and/or for emergency situations such as an attack to the DAO treasury. 

### Enforcement

The on-chain mechanism for enforcement will depend on the completion of [Celeste](https://1hive.gitbook.io/celeste/) -  a subjective oracle that uses predictable, inclusive, and democratic means to resolve disputes arising from optimistic actions.

The ability for Giveth to enforce this covenant is limited to the direct interactions that community members have with the protocol, specifically the ability for community members to submit proposals to allocate GIV issuance or adjust protocol parameters.

When using the GIVgarden, the proposer will be required to deposit GIV when submitting a proposal, attesting that the impact of the proposal could be reasonably considered to align with Giveth's social contract. A dispute can be created by another community member if they disagree with the proposer's attestation by challenging the proposal and staking an equivalent amount of GIV. If after being challenged the proposal is not withdrawn, a decentralized oracle (Celeste) will be used to settle the dispute. If the oracle responds in favour of the proposer, the proposal will be unlocked and the challenger’s stake will be transferred to the proposer. On the other hand, if the dispute resolves in favour of the challenger, the proposal will be removed from consideration and the proposer's stake will be given to the challenger.

Participants in the dispute resolution protocol are expected to review the proposal, this covenant and related past disputes in order to provide a judgement that they feel best aligns with the established norms and intention of the Giveth community.

## Off-chain

### Decision Making

Giveth uses [Advice Process](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/adviceProcess) as its primary practice for flat decision making to empower contributors with agency to move their cultural proposals forward.  Advice Process is written in the Giveth documentation and promoted verbally in community calls. When a non-financial, no-code decision will likely affect a large part of the community, the use of off-chain voting using polls in the Discord or Forum is implemented. A decision is considered legitimate when it respects this covenant, is promoted to the awareness of the community and its results aren’t challenged within 2 weeks. 

Giveth community spaces, including the Giveth [Forum](https://forum.giveth.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Giveth) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/JxF38Tj364), as well as other off-chain forums that may emerge in the future, are expected to adhere to this covenant.

### Enforcement

Giveth intends to use [Gravity Conflict Management](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-general-process/173) and make use of its graduated sanctions in order to ensure community standards.
