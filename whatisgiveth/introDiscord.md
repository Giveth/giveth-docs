You can praise a fellow community member in any channel by typing **`/praise`** followed by "@" and their username. Don't forget to mention why you're praising them.

**For example:** `/praise @WhyldWanderer for creating such an amazing Discord Guide` :stuck_out_tongue:

Once you have typed your praise, you will know that the bot has tracked it because a ✅ emoji will appear as a reaction to your message.

When you receive praise, you will be notified by the bot in your direct messages with a link to the message where you were praised.


#### Simple Poll Bot
This bot can be used to create a straw poll such as this one:

![](https://i.imgur.com/ExLeqzW.png)


To create the poll shown above, you would simply type the command as follows:
`/poll "What is the best poll bot?" "Simple Poll" "R2D2"`

By following this template, you can create as many answers to the question you would like and community members can answer by reacting with the corresponding emoji.
`/poll` `"Question"` `"Answer #1"` `"Answer#2"` `"Answer #3"` ..etc.
