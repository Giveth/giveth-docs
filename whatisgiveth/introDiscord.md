## Background - Migration to Discord
We have moved the majority of our community chat and contributor collaboration from Riot.im (now Element Chat) to a new server on Discord.

We are using a message relay bridge between Discord, Telegram and Element Chat that reliably mirrors the messages of a few chosen channels between the three applications. If Discord isn't for you, fear not! You can still interact with us using Telegram or Element chat.

The bridging software used is matterbridge. - Shout out to `@geleeroyale` for making the magic happen!

Join the Giveth community server https://discord.giveth.io/
Inside each server, you can have a unique nickname so feel free to change yours to whatever you would like to be known as.

Once you have joined the server, a bot will send you a message with a Captcha to solve - you're not a robot are you? It should look something like this:

#### PraiseBot
At Giveth, we love to acknowledge the value that each member brings to the community and provide recognition for the awesomeness that they contribute. The praise given is tracked by PraiseBot and used to calculate rewards for active contributors.

You can praise a fellow community member in any channel by typing **`!praise`** followed by "@" and their username. Dont forget to mention why your praising them.

**For example:** `!praise @WhyldWanderer for creating such an amazing Discord Guide` :stuck_out_tongue:

Once you have typed your praise, you will know that the bot has tracked it because a ✅ emoji will appear as a reaction to your message.

When you receive praise, you will be notified by the bot in your direct messages with a link to the message where you were praised.


#### Simple Poll Bot
This bot can be used to create a straw poll such as this one:

![](https://i.imgur.com/ExLeqzW.png)


To create the poll shown above, you would simply type the command as follows:
`/poll "What is the best poll bot?" "Simple Poll" "R2D2"`

By following this template, you can create as many answers to the question you would like and community members can answer by reacting with the corresponding emoji.
`/poll` `"Question"` `"Answer #1"` `"Answer#2"` `"Answer #3"` ..etc.
