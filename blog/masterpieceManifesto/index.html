What are some of the crazy things we believe in? After working with the team for +7 months now (which is years in blockchain time) these are some of the thoughts that come to mind…</em></strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-are-a-community">We are a Community<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-a-community" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>What we are doing is not about the technology. Most of us are very, very tech-minded and geeky people, and we love tech, but that is not what it is about or why we are here. It is about the people, the human connection.</p><p>We live in a world that has never been more connected, but never have we felt more isolated, never have our individualistic traits and our ego been more nurtured (think social media, for one) than today. But has it made us happier? Definitely not. Even worse, it has made us retreat into ourselves, giving less, both emotionally as well as financially. Giveth wants to turn the tide, bring back the connection by building/buidling and making the World a Better Place.</p><p>We are not an organization, not a DAO, we strive to be more, we are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (a DAC). Communities are based on shared values and this is what corporations and organizations lack. They do pretend to have core values, but these are outward facing, top-down and are used for branding purposes. Our values are bottom-up, crowdsourced and are the higher good that connects us.</p><p>We are a community of individuals and we celebrate and respect each and everyone’s uniqueness.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-dare-to-be-vulnerable">We dare to be Vulnerable<a class="hash-link" href="#we-dare-to-be-vulnerable" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Our main value, our essence lies in vulnerability. Most of the people at Giveth, and even in the wider ‘Maker’ blockchain space (=the opposite of daytrader land) are here because they know what ego and image brings to the world. They are professionals who have lived the corporate life and knew something was ‘off’. Hierarchy and image boosting bring pain, misunderstanding and most of all a huge waste of time and loads of inefficiency.</p><p>When you dare to be vulnerable - even fragile, open and true - you can make lasting changes, because it’s the only way to truly connect with another human being. And together, when you connect, you always achieve more.</p><p>Another crucial reason to open up is because ‘the system’ has trained us to be numb by providing us with all possible tools (binge-watching, medication, social media, shopping, … the list is endless). We have been trained to care less, to be less conscious of suffering and injustice, during a time where we are actually hyper-connected and thus can be hyper-informed. Knowledge brings power: sharing your thoughts, ideas and feelings can change the world. We just have to express our <strong>outrage</strong> and team up, because right now, as individuals, together, we actually have a bigger impact than ever before in the history of mankind.</p></blockquote><p>(Please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THIS</a> if you never have before)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-are-inclusive">We are Inclusive<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-inclusive" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Everyone is welcome, we are huggers. We believe everyone has talents, has skills and can contribute to Making the World a Better Place. If you see a need in our community you should come over and get it done (see ‘We are Makers’). But even if you just want to lurk around, you should, even just you being there inspires us and we hope to inspire you.</p><p>We believe in equal rights, even more, this is a given, this is no topic of discussion. No matter what gender, race, religion or political philosophy you adhere to: you are welcome, and you will be loved. Because giveth is all about community.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-advocate-abundance">We advocate Abundance<a class="hash-link" href="#we-advocate-abundance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>When there is abundance people shine. Abundance is the opposite of fear and scarcity, the things that make people become protective and close-minded. We want to give people the chance to develop themselves. We want to be a spark of light, a pulsing star in this galaxy, an inspiration to others, an energy that rubs off.</p><p>Only if we harness this internal energy we will be able to make real and lasting change in this world. When there is abundance people thrive and are able to not only show off their skills but their talents. The difference between skills and talents is that you no longer only do what you are good at, you do what brings happiness into your life and you bring this into the lives of others.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-are-striving-to-be-fully-decentralized">We are striving to be fully Decentralized<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-striving-to-be-fully-decentralized" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Money is not evil.

Some of us dream of traveling to far off places and delivering cold, clean drinking water to those who are thirsty. Some imagine providing housing for the ever-growing homeless and refugee populations worldwide. Others picture themselves developing a small plot of land for inner-city children to learn about gardening. Whether global or local, big or small, many of us truly want to help others.</p><p>But how do we actually help? How do we go about making a real impact?</p><p>If we have money available to donate to people in need, we soon discover the seemingly infinite layers of vampiric bureaucracy between our donations and the intended recipients, massively decreasing our intended impact.</p><p>If we have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, we’re soon disillusioned by the major inefficiencies, lack of training and organization, misallocation of resources, and other issues that exist within hierarchically managed systems.</p><p>If we have willpower and like-minded individuals and we decide to initiate our own causes, we quickly encounter regulatory roadblocks and resistance from archaic systems of centralized power, diverting our focus away from doing good and toward filling out paperwork and paying fees, if we’re allowed to proceed at all.</p><p>We exhaust ourselves trying to do good through traditional channels, and the question still remains: how do we actually help? How do we go about making a real impact?</p><p>When the systems available to us are inherently flawed, we stop relying upon those systems to achieve our goals. With tools and technologies hitherto nonexistent, we instead build a new platform for giving for the future.</p><p>The desire to make the world a better place hasn’t changed, but the tools available to do so have. At the intersection of this drive to do good and the opportunities opened up to us through blockchain technology and decentralized governance, you’ll find a group of individuals known as Unicorns. These Unicorns are all a part of a growing, global community dedicated to changing the way we give. This decentralized altruistic community is known as Giveth.</p><p>Like the Unicorns who make up Giveth, Giveth is diverse and ever-growing.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Giveth is both a culture and a manifestation of intent.</li><li>Giveth is an expression of love and the result of action and hard work.</li><li>Giveth is a transparent proof of decentralized governance in action.</li><li>Giveth is an amalgamation of altruism and the adjacent possible.</li><li>Giveth is a global community and a gift to the world.</li><li>Giveth is open, welcoming, and ready to support you in making the world a better place.</li></ul><blockquote><p>If you have money available to donate to people in need, you can watch its transmittance across the world on an open ledger to assure it actually gets to those who need it. With the tools and technologies available to us, there’s no more bureaucracy to siphon off funds along the way to the recipients. Giveth doesn’t even take a cut — it doesn’t need to — it’s funded through the same process as the project you just donated to.</p><p>If you have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, you’ll find the Giveth platform maximizes the efficiency and impact of the work you do with clearly defined milestones and the minimal number of actors needed to accomplish the goal. Transparency and accountability are built in, so your work is both noticed and supported by your fellow Unicorns as well as the donors themselves.</p><p>If you have willpower and like-minded individuals and you decide to initiate your own causes, you’ll discover an easy-to-use toolset that enables you to create a project with the same ease as creating a blog post. You’ll immediately be able to start receiving donations and create clear steps to achieving your ultimate outcome with no red-tape or fees of any kind.</p><p>The best part about Giveth is that anybody can join the community and contribute to making the world a better place. If you’re a human being living on planet Earth and you want to do good, we are your people, and this is your opportunity to make a real impact.

On a personal level Giveth is the reason I shifted my vision from only seeing fungible stores of value loosely referred to as ‘crypto’ and decided to dedicate my corporeal energy to enabling trust within this space. A bit about me is in order first however.</p><p>I came to ‘crypto’ not as a newbie but someone who was well versed in utilizing cryptographic hashes and technology within daily operations. My first introduction to personal computers came in 1986 when my family moved to Houston TX, and I would play games like ‘Wheel of Fortune’ , ‘Ninja Gaiden’, and ‘SpiderMan’ on our IBM 8086. My first tech job came at the age of 17 where I taught children QBASIC, html, and audio processing at the ‘American Computer Experience’ summer camps. Fast forward to 2009 and my technolust was immediately sparked by this thing I caught wind of called Bitcoin. I had no position in the market other than watching the price of BTC go from near nothing to over $10 USD/BTC.</p><p>In August of 2017 life dealt me two perspective altering situations within a week: Hurricane Harvey and losing my job as a Corporate Security Analyst of 5 years. The loss of my position was heartbreaking but being surrounded by constant destruction brought on by an “800 year flood” kept me sane and sober. By December life had begun to return back to normal for most of us Houstonian’s, however something incredible was taking place with the price of Bitcoin: it was over $10,000/BTC!</p><p>The dramatic increase of volume plus pricing momentum within Bitcoin caused me to study value theory and seriously contemplate just wtf was going on. Whether it was serendipity, fate, or just plain dumb luck I discovered Giveth via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShzx6iqwus&amp;index=15&amp;list=PLIR2KLUqBsWnbhDZKi0S43Q5PnxFGdiEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube presentation</a> from Griff Green at the Ethereum Community Conference 2018. At this point all of my attention shifted studying pricing and volatility to determining how to best distribute trust.</p><p>Giveth will play a key role in enabling communities to distribute trust via decentralized governance. At a high level, Giveth can be viewed as software that enables communities to form causes and promote those causes via group determined milestones. Individuals who are part of a given community can spawn their own milestones, and via pledging of ETH to those milestones prioritize what is and is not important for that community with 100% transparency. Additionally those who give within this structure can be notified when their milestone is reached as well as delegate authority of their contribution to others within their community.</p><p>Giveth is not an ICO, a corporation, or a monolithic organization that promises to render aid while capturing the majority of users contributions in times of need (most charities). Giveth is an opportunity to do better by humanity via distributed trust within systems of decentralized governance that <!-- -->*<!-- -->anyone<!-- -->*<!-- --> can run.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/40f75102c422?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Meefs</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩</p><blockquote><p>~DAppLion</p></blockquote><p>🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧</p><p><strong>Why Giveth?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We believe in the power of communities to solve problems.</p><p>We believe in decentralized technology to unleash the creativity and energy of altruistic communities.</p><p>Giving is a humanitarian act of solidarity and empathy — we believe in the fundamental rights and dignity of every human being.</p><p>We are doing nothing less than reinventing giving!</p></blockquote><p><strong>What?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We build a platform for trust and transparency in giving.</p><p>Decentralized altruistic communities promote social innovation and create opportunities for people.</p><p>This platform is in strong contrast to the systems currently in place: bureaucratic, inflexible, centralized, with a lot of overhead</p></blockquote><p><strong>How?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We are enthusiastic and passionate — we do a hell of a lot of amazing stuff.</p><p>We are a community — open, transparent, cooperative, companionable and focused to deliver.</p><p>We are an active part of the Ethereum eco-system and contribute to the development of Ethereum.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Ron Mat</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️</p><blockquote><p><strong>“You can’t go around building a better world for people. Only people can build a better world. Otherwise it’s just a cage.” — Terry Pratchett</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want to understand what Giveth values are and what it means to be a Unicorn and to be part of the Giveth community, you has to understand that the simple goal of all Unicorns in the Giveth galaxy, all around the world is, to make the world a better place.</p><p>This starts with the fact that Giveth trusts in people, real, actual people.</p><p>Let me explain why this is an amazing, outstanding fact in 2018. We spend the last years and maybe generation with the trust in the big systems and cooperations. The (centralized) banking system, centralized political systems with so called “representatives of the people” who rule countries and do not even know any longer what is going on in a country, the idea that the fact that we are allowed to go to vote every 4 (or 5 years) is all it needs for a democracy to work. We trusted in this centralized systems to rule the world and sort out our human problems. What we end up with was a banking crisis, plastic rubbish all over the planet, a so called refugee crisis and more and more the distrust in systems. We trust in charity organizations all over the world to sort out what we humans fucked up in the past and wonder in the end that we do not know what happened with the donations that we made. We trusted in system for a long time, until we realized that this systems are not working out the way we wanted. We realized that no one will sort out all the rubbish in the oceans and at the beaches if we do not start doing it ourselves, more and more people realize that we need to take our power as citizens back to actually have a say in a democracy, we start to realize that it makes sense to have a reliable person we can trust instead of a bank. We start to realize that centralized systems do not work out the way we though. Decentralization and the trust in people, actually people are two of the main values of Giveth. All these people, all over the world, who contribute their love and time, their work and ideas into Giveth are Unicorns. People with ideas who want to be part of the movement to change the world and make it a better place are Unicorns.</p><p>Giveth wants to give power back to people while decentralizing systems. One of Giveths goals and values is to make a donation system transparent, complete and absolute. We want to make donations transparent, direct and reliable. And even if Giveth is a charity organization, we are not just talking about donations. We are talking about the structure of governance within the organization, about reliable, accountable people within the Giveth galaxy, about the fact that everyone and anyone can actively participate in the platform, the organization and the idea of Giveth. The future of giving is not just giving ether to a cause that needs support. Giving can of course be monetary but can also be work force, bodys, love, time, minds and ideas for the greater good.</p><p>A lot of people already volunteer for a good cause, give time and love to a project or an idea. Giveth is on the way to build a platform that allows any one of us to make a real change in our community, our neighborhood. I will be able to put up a cause that is important in my direct neighborhood and will make a change and a direct impact in my community — and you can too. Because, you not what? No one knows better what’s going on in your neighborhood than you. Why should anyone donate money to a big, intransparent organization that pays CEO’s instead of directly to your cause? Your community wants to teach kids how to code, you want to feed the homeless people, you want to gather a couple of people and pick up all the rubbish at your local beach/town/park? Cool, put up a cause on the Giveth platform and start to do so. Giveth believes and trusts in people and in you. This is the highest value any organization can have: the trust in people.</p><p>Shaping the future needs more than just a couple of people, it needs all of us, the human community. So we are calling everyone, to become a Unicorn and join us in the movement to #maketheworldabtterplace.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong> <a href="https://medium.com/u/7d328be176a3?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>jen Giveth</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌</p><blockquote><p><em>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>we were all going direct the other way”</em></a></p></blockquote><p><strong><em>–</em> in short the Unicorns were getting easier and easier to spot as they were coming together to reinvent the most fundamental thing there is.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Giveth is reinventing what it means to be human.</strong></p><p>Humans are not the only life form which create but we have made it our ultimate evolutionary skill. To create is to give and vice versa. Giving is the most primal expression of creating, the most basic level. To voluntarily give something that is yours ( mind, body, property…) by leaving your ownership it becomes something for somebody else. In other words : something changed, transformed, got created.</p><p>So giving, What’s so special about that? Everybody does it in one way or another. But the giving the Unicorns are talking about is voluntarily or coercion-free! This means no one can force you in any way. Nor are there gatekeepers who have the power to interfere in the process of you giving. The Giveth Unicorns credo is very clear :</p><p>• Donating can be simple, fun and effective.</p><p>• Transparency and accountability can be the default.</p><p>• Every idea has the potential to make a positive impact, and it can be heard and funded in a decentralized fashion.</p><p>• Every Donor can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.</p><p>• People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.</p><p>• Real change and innovation comes about when communities join together to make the world a better place.</p><p>Unicorns have always been elusive creatures but now the stars in the Giveth Galaxy have aligned and they are popping up everywhere. Everywhere people are noticing what is being built, being reinvented and want to contribute. The moment you give your time, your energy, your love to this community and project, and help in some way in its existence, a new Unicorn is born.</p><p>Permissionless creation will make us unstoppable. It gives hope for the future and the confidence that there will always be people who act for the good of others and that they will succeed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Xilef</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽</p><blockquote><p>There are restrictive walls that contain possibility. Inside these walls passion and motivation are strangled by bureaucracy, limitations, and unrelated political tethers. Giveth breaks down these walls and exposes possibility to the wide open expanse contained only by the one natural restriction, capacity. Giveth is where possibility meets capacity, where, passion and motivation are free to flourish and where only nature itself can restrain us.</p><p>Those with the passion to change the world sit on one side of a vast and long continent, on the other side are those who want to help them and have the resources to make their vision possible. Giveth is a canal right through the middle of that continent, removing the need to go all the way around and convincing more and more people on both sides to make the journey from the world we live in to the world we believe in.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Giveth is a decentralized platform that facilitates better giving and better receiving, contributing to creating a better world</li><li>Giveth creates increased transparency and allows results based giving for individual donors, in turn inspiring creation of more and more givers and more and more change makers</li><li>Giveth believes in connecting change makers with those who want to support their mission, allowing them to avoid the mission creep that comes with chasing semi-related funding</li><li>Giveth believes in decentralized, democratic, liquid control of donor funds</li><li>Giveth believes in maximizing each gifts potential, utilizing blockchain technology to decrease administrative cost requirements</li><li>Giveth believes in giving change makers the funds and trust they need to make the change they want to see a reality</li></ul><blockquote><p>~<a href="https://medium.com/u/5d71f4e010d?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Williams</a></p></blockquote><p>🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗</p><blockquote><p>Unicorns, previously thought of as being as elusive as they are mysterious and wondrous are in actuality easier to see than one would think and you even possess what it takes to be one. With transparency at the height of their values, however, they are just as easily looked past as they are open with their ability to share and positively impact their world. Hiding in the plain sight of the blockchain forests, these Unicorns believe in a simplicity that allow the moving parts of the world they believe in to glide seamlessly together without the need of a centralized force to guide them. They hope to give the power over sharing and donation out to the very people participating in order to stimulate a positive change of attitude and integrity for the <strong>Decentralized Altruistic Communities</strong> that they are a part of. By using this value system based on participation, innovation, transparency, and accountability the Giveth Unicorns hope to use smart contracts to put donors in charge of how their funds are used, they hope to allow that direct relationship to create a rewarding system for all who are involved so that positivity is felt at the very core of each donation. Giveth Unicorns know that sharing should feel good and that goodness has the ability to shift attitudes of the world for the better, for a more common force toward one another acting accountable and responsible for what they are putting out into the place we’re all a part of.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Zak Perna</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨</p><blockquote><p>Dear Galaxy,</p><p>If you’re reading this we’ve done it, all the work the Unicorn troopers fought for was not in vain.</p><p><strong>The mission we set out to accomplish was clear:</strong></p><p><em>Create a trustless system of self governing bodies, capable of uniting around causes they choose to support.</em></p><p><em>Build a platform that fosters experimentation, collaboration and open source initiatives.</em></p><p><em>Awaken the Giver within all the citizen of this Galaxy and beyond, by showing them how and where their contributions make a difference.</em></p><p>The Centralization forces were determined to keep the Galaxy under their control, well we couldn’t let that happen, not for our sake and the sake of generations to come.</p><p>To accomplish our mission we had to do something greater than simply unseating the unjust forces.</p><p>We had to show them a better way!</p><p><strong>The way of the Unicorn.</strong></p><p>We started a battle that will never end, the fight for truth, justice and transparency between citizens and powers is one that must live on forever.</p><p>It’s up to you to keep this fight alive all throughout your Galaxy, to inspire, incite and expose the truth for all to see.</p><p>This was the cause we chose to fight for, the one we believed mattered most to our generation.</p><p>Now it’s your turn to decide, what will you fight for?</p><p>We’ve given you the tools to sculpt your future, to build your community and free yourselves.</p><p>Use them wisely and never, EVER…… <strong>Forget!</strong></p><p><strong>The way of the</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/YalorMewn/status/992864729407291392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Unicorn</strong></a> ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/33144025168f?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Yalor Tackson</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗</p><blockquote><p>Giveth is a global community focused on improving the world through blockchain technology.</p><p>Trustless systems like a distributed ledger allow us to eliminate the middle man, cut down costs and provide transparency and accountability.
