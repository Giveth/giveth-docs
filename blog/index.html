We have the tools to open new funding streams and create economic abundance for everyone who is providing value to society.</p><p>Clean air, clear water, bridges, roads, free childcare, public education, taking care of the less fortunate — these are all examples of public goods that, when governments fail to provide them, we look to non-profits to create and care for. For funding, we have been relying on donors to give to these non-profits and receive nothing in return. Society has been depending on and <a href="https://youtu.be/PFy458wCQ0g?t=504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimately exploiting the altruists</a> who are working hard to protect and provide for our collective needs.</p><p><strong>GIVbacks is a paradigm shift for the donation space. For the first time ever, there is an economic upside to donating.</strong></p><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme1.png" class="img_ev3q"><p>GIVbacks is the first step towards a world in which everyone benefits from creating value: <strong>when you give to verified projects, 100% of your donation goes directly to the project, and you get</strong> <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/#about-giv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GIV</strong></a> <strong>from Giveth!</strong></p><p>With over 900 verified projects on Giveth, donors can find projects that speak to their values and get rewarded for giving.

On the flip side, donors are being asked to sacrifice — to give without expecting anything in return.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme2.png" class="img_ev3q"><p>GIVbacks is changing that. Donors have the opportunity to support projects they believe in, get GIV in return, and start or increase their <a href="https://giveth.io/givstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVstream</a>. They can use that GIV to grow their rewards by, for example, staking in the <a href="https://giveth.io/givfarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVfarm</a>. It’s a win/win: Projects benefit from receiving 100% of the donation, and donors benefit by earning GIV and becoming part of the Giveth ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="givbacks-gives-governance-power-to-the-donors-using-giveth">GIVbacks gives governance power to the donors using Giveth<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-gives-governance-power-to-the-donors-using-giveth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme3.png" class="img_ev3q"><p>Giveth is of the donors, by the donors, and for the donors. <a href="https://giveth.io/claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our GIVdrop</a> was sent to the Blockchain4good community — <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and particularly crypto donors &amp; Giveth users</a> — because we wanted to kickstart the <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVeconomy</a> with value-aligned GIVers. Now, as the economy expands, we want the donors who are using the platform and giving to causes they care about to get proportionally increasing governance power. With GIVbacks, the more you give, the more GIV you get, and that GIV can be used in the <a href="https://giveth.io/givgarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVgarden</a> to decide which proposals get funded to expand the GIVeconomy.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="givbacks-are-like-tax-deductible-donations-but-without-governments-and-borders">GIVbacks are like tax-deductible donations but without governments and borders<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-are-like-tax-deductible-donations-but-without-governments-and-borders" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme4.png" class="img_ev3q"><p>Let’s face it, tax-deductible donations can be a bit of a headache. Nonprofit projects have to cut through miles of red tape and donors have to do accounting each year, saving associated paperwork for some arbitrary number of years.</p><p>GIVbacks provides a similar end, but cuts the bureaucracy. If a project can prove they are legitimately adding value to society, they can become a verified project in the GIVbacks program, no matter what their legal or DAO structure is. If a donor is moved by a verified project’s work, they can give and receive GIV in return, no matter where (or if) they pay taxes. No need to save receipts or paperwork for fear of getting audited. Web3 makes it so that we don’t need governments and taxes to make this kind of system. We can transcend borders to connect people with projects anywhere in the world!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="givbacks-educates-community-members-about-web3">GIVbacks educates community members about web3<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-educates-community-members-about-web3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme5.png" class="img_ev3q"><p>The long-term vision of Giveth is to enable for-good projects to use token engineering and DAO coordination on the ground. GIVbacks is <a href="https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first step towards achieving this goal</a>. With GIVbacks, ordinary donors start learning about and getting curious about DAO tools like <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token streams</a>, <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givfarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeFi</a> and <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givgarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token-weighted voting</a>. Furthermore, when donors get GIV, they are naturally inclined to donate it!

Well, it makes use of a system for verifying projects on Giveth, and tracks donations to those projects in 2 week “rounds”.

Many Verified projects came pre-vetted from <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGivingBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Giving Block</a> API. The Giving Block is an organization that supports and onboards registered 501c3s from the United States into crypto, and with our integration you can donate to their projects from the Giveth UI.</p><p>For non-Giving Block projects, project owners need to fill out a <a href="https://giveth.typeform.com/verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typeform</a> and answer some questions. Verified Projects need to show that they are doing work to create <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/market-failure-and-the-role-of-government/externalities-topic/a/public-goods-cnx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-excludable</a> value for society and that they have some reputation at stake that would prevent them from gaming or manipulating the GIVbacks program for personal gain.</p><p>Our amazing Project Verification Team then reviews these applications, investigates the information provided &amp; informs the project owners about the verdict. Approved projects will have their Verified badges <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#project-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at the start of the very next GIVbacks round</a>.

As in any good experiment, discoveries arose from these iterations and in October 2021, the rGIV DAO voted to retire the rGIV token in favor of creating a new instance (nrGIV) with several configuration changes, including the move from 1,111 to 1, ditching the extra digits.</p><p><strong><em>Also changed in this new rGIV DAO: the distribution of tokens now follows a Fibonacci sequence. This means that the number of tokens minted for each contributor in the latest period is equal to the sum of the two previous two periods.</em></strong></p><p>As shown, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOfficeMystic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dani</a> has been contributing since day 1. She earned 1 token to vote with the first period (1,111 — which was converted to 1 in the new simplified DAO), 2 tokens for the second period, 3 tokens the third period (because 1 + 2 = 3), and 5 tokens the fourth period (because 2 + 3 = 5). If she stops contributing there, she will retain her total balance of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11 nrGiv tokens for voting on governance proposals after the 4th period. If she continues consistently contributing to the Giveth Community, she will always have at least 1 token more than any contributors that came in later.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="the nrGIV DAO token holders" src="/img/blog/rgivDAOtokenHolders.png" class="img_ev3q"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/positonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a> is a co-founder of the rGIV DAO, and received tokens for periods 1, 2, and 3. He resigned during the 3rd period to focus on <a href="https://toucan.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toucan.earth</a>, and did not contribute during the 4th period, so does not qualify for the minting of 5 tokens. His voting weight remains at 6 tokens, while current contributors weight grows to 11. In this case where a past contributor does not return for 6 months and misses 2 full periods, their voting weight is now lower than a new contributor receiving nrGIV tokens during those two mintings.</p><p>So in this example, new contributors in periods 4 and 5 receive 8 tokens (3 + 5) bringing their total to 12 (5 + 8) — double that of James. When James returns, he will come in with his previous token weight and after another 3 months of contributions, qualifies to again receive nrGIV tokens.</p><p>In this way new contributors can gain as much influence as someone who has contributed in the prior two time periods, and over time the influence of past contributors is reduced after exiting the community. Behind this design is an assumption that those currently contributing can make the most informed vote about current governance of the organization. For consistent contributors who have been around from the beginning, those joining later will never reach or surpass your voting power, incentivizing retention of talent and wisdom for the community while incrementally fractionalizing the lead.</p><blockquote><p>Successful decentralized governance has been shown to require a healthy balance of new contributors being valued early, and long-time contributors valued for carrying the vital threads of vision, mission and information on the organization from past experience.</p></blockquote><p>Note: If you are on maternity or paternity leave, you still get the period’s token allocations during leave.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-nrgiv-token-used-for">What is the nrGIV token used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-nrgiv-token-used-for" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Voting on proposals that build the #FutureofGiving</strong></p><p>Anyone can make a proposal to the rGIV DAO, whether they are an nrGIV token holder or not. But first! Giveth follows a Sociocratic proposal-forming process by soliciting opinions and clarifying questions initially, then making revisions and polling for support via an Advice Process on our forum.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Previously hosted on</strong> <a href="https://www.loomio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Loomio</strong></a><strong>, you can see the proposal process</strong> <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/4TKQjvCg/configuring-giveth-dao-rep-token-on-aragon-1hive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>used to initiate the rGIV DAO</strong></a> <strong>here!</strong></p></blockquote><p>In 2021 Giveth revised its organizational structure into new Circles and Working Groups while launching a <a href="https://forum.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new proposal management method on Discourse</a>:</p><img loading="lazy" alt="the giveth forum" src="/img/blog/rgivDAOforum.png" class="img_ev3q"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-off-chain-advice-to-on-chain-voting">From Off-chain Advice to On-chain Voting<a class="hash-link" href="#from-off-chain-advice-to-on-chain-voting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>After a proposal has been reviewed, the champion (person writing and advocating for the proposal) can post a new Vote to the rGIV DAO! Once made, nrGIV token holders have 5 days to use their tokens and vote “yes” or “no”. Voting on each proposal in this DAO allocates your fully accrued nrGIV token quantity; and you do not lose them if you vote. In other words, if you have 7 tokens, and you vote “yes,” then 7 nrGIV tokens are added to the total “yes” votes while the tokens remain in your wallet. When you vote on other proposals, you still have 7 nrGIV tokens to vote on those as well.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Giveth Reputation DAO does not use Conviction Voting or require you to “stake” your reputation tokens — you never lose your tokens or have to choose which proposal to use them on; you always have the same number of tokens to vote with for each new proposal.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In order for a proposal to pass, it must have a majority of yes votes, and reach a “minimum approval” level, which we’ve set at 25%. If a proposal doesn’t have more than 25% of all minted tokens voting yes on it, it automatically does not pass regardless of the distribution of “yes” and “no” votes given. However, the proposal can always be proposed again and voted on again.</p><p>The second metric within each vote is the “Support” level. We have set that at 88%. If a vote reaches this level, it has more than the majority by a large margin and is labeled as having strong support. The third metric set by the DAO is “vote duration”; how much time must pass before voting is closed.</p><h1>Which Decisions Does the Giveth Reputation DAO Need to Vote on?</h1><p>The rGIV DAO has the responsibility for governing the GIVeconomy launch and our commons. This means that the assets built by the Giveth community and the funding received from donors to support Giveth are owned by the Community itself — the Givers and Makers contributing their skills, time, energy and resources to it. So deciding how to build the DApps, contract with individuals to fill roles on the team, and distribute funds to the Circles for maintaining operations and development of the open source code is a job for nrGIV token holders that collectively make up the rGIV DAO.</p><p>The road to decentralized governance has been paved with the bricks of this goodwill, and you can see again in Loomio how the Giveth Unicorn DAC used the Advice Process and voting to decide how to <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/Sbn1FeT7/285-eth-what-am-i-gonna-do-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allocate a 285 ETH gift in 2019</a>!</p><p>The Giveth Reputation DAO has the opportunity to do this again now as we contemplate allocation of the proceeds from <a href="https://medium.com/rainbow-rollup/nftps-rainbow-rolls-7a01d5eb1bb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow Rolls</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retropgf-experiment-1-1-million-dollars-for-public-goods-f7e455cbdca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Grant</a>.

Untangling our relationship, as humans, with plastic will be one of the great challenges of our time. UPF Coin is a project by Unplastify which, as the name implies, is on a mission to put the brakes on our consumption of plastic. Unplastify is based out of Argentina and the USA, and provides a wide range of educational and practical activities promoting unplastification.</p><p>Their primary area of interest is the crippling effects of plastic waste in our oceans. To that end in 2018 they embarked on an epic oceanic adventure where the team took off on a sailboat named “Fanky” across the Atlantic and back, collecting plastic samples and researching impacts and alternatives to plastic. Their voyage took them from the ports of New York City all the way to Corsica and back across the pond to Buenos Aires, Argentina. You can check out more of the work unplastify does on <a href="https://www.unplastify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</p><p>The UPF Coin project introduces the powerful realities of blockchain and tokenization to their noble cause. At the heart of this lies a proprietary UPF blockchain which operates on a “proof of unplastify work” to distribute UPF coins. Every coin minted represents one tonne of avoided plastic consumption. Unplastification work done will be human validated by the UPF team. They plan to have a working blockchain and 25 UPF coins emitted by the end of this quarter! That’s 25 tonnes of plastic mitigated. Donations to their project will help them research and fund the deployment of the UPF token economy. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/upf-coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out UPF Coin on giveth.io</a> and make a donation!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Positive Blockchain" src="/img/blog/positiveBlockchain.png" class="img_ev3q"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="positive-blockchain">Positive Blockchain<a class="hash-link" href="#positive-blockchain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With an ever-increasing emergence of ‘blockchain-for-good’ projects, how can anyone keep up with all these amazing high vibes?

The game-changing dynamics of blockchain are pervasive across an expansive list of modern industries. CineFi is introducing a platform to revolutionize funding and revenue streams from film-making.</p><p>The CineFi Network begins with artists submitting proposals for films they’re inspired to create. A CineFi token (CINE) will be the medium through which users can interact with proposals and films. Platform users can decide whether or not to invest funds (CINE) into bringing the film proposals into fruition. If the film reaches its funding goal a fractilized NFT is generated which represents proportional rights to creators and investors of the film, guaranteeing a cut of the revenues generated. The platform also allows users to stream or purchase these decentrally financed films with the same CINE tokens.</p><p>By this novel system, CineFi effectively allows for real-time community signalling for what films they want to see made. Thanks to Blockchain technology, creators and artists can more transparently navigate the terms on which they share revenues generated from their works. The blockchain becomes the final source of truth for where the fractalized NFTs are distributed, where funding comes from and where revenues go.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://cinefi.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CineFi website</a> we can hope to see film proposals rolling in by around mid-2022.

They are focused on yielding saplings and food surpluses with the intention to move away from tourism and find alternative income sources.</li><li><strong>Huni Kui — Caucho</strong> — Dwelling in the basins of the rivers Juruà and Purus, the village of Caucho strives to reclaim their culture from the shocks of colonial industrialization. The Amazon Rubber Boom eroded much of their ancestral culture. They believe in sowing their culture through music, dance and art.</li><li><strong>Kuntanawa</strong> or “Coconut People” — Believe that plants are the way to connect with the spirits of the forest.

The Handshake Development (HNS) Fund is the community funding the Handshake protocol and affiliated systems. HNS at its core is a system for distributing internet domain names using cryptocurrency technology. The HNS protocol website hits home the need for better domain name distribution framework:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Names on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. . . . Services on the internet have become more centralized beginning in the 1990s, but do not fulfill the original decentralized vision of the internet. . . . Centralization exists because there is a need to manage spam, griefing, and sockpuppet/sybil attacks. Previous decentralized systems largely stopped working due to spam. If it were more costly to grief on the internet using decentralized systems, the need for trusted centralized corporations to manage these risks decrease.”</em></p></blockquote><p>HNS uses a token (aptly named HNS) to register domain names. Using these cryptographic tokens, participants can transfer and update their registered names. By creating a decentralized and accountable system, HNS (by way of its users) can inhibit a centralized actor from scooping up all the domain names. The HNS Fund seeks out donations to keep afloat their open-source tools, such as DNS records, domain registries, and educational content. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/handshake-development-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to support HNS public goods!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Njome Innovation Academy" src="/img/blog/NjombeIA.png" class="img_ev3q"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="njombe-innovation-academy">Njombe Innovation Academy<a class="hash-link" href="#njombe-innovation-academy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>is creating the next generation of African entrepreneurs in Njombe, Tanzania. Njombe Innovation Academy (NIA) is importing the Social Innovation Academy (SINA) educational model which began in Uganda. The premise of SINA is to invite members of marginalized african demographics with passion and ideas to a co-living experience to gain the entrepreneurial skills to make their dreams a reality. SINA has proven to be extremely successful, tackling prevailing African issues around failing education systems and corresponding unemployment rates. Njombe Innovation Academy profoundly lays out their <strong>Theory for Change</strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The desired impact (of NIA) is an increased number of social challenges tackled in Njombe by youth-led enterprises with locally available resources. . . . we will bootstrap a self-organised community of youth in Njombe who commonly owns(sic) and manages(sic) resources (material, knowledge, financial, social) to create social enterprises out of challenges . . . “</em></p></blockquote><p>SINA communities have been spreading around the continent and Uganda is ready, more than ever, for it’s own local SINA node. NIA identifies that local youth unemployment hovers around 10% with more than 40% never completing secondary school. Crippling rates of malnutrition and HIV hamper the societal and economic growth of Njombe.</p><p>Njombe Innovation Academy has outlined a clear plan for kick-starting the local SINA community. The first step is to send 3 local youth from Njombe to Uganda to gain insight from the original SINA. Then, with supporting members and facilities, these successful graduates begin to train subsequent cohorts of entrepreneurs. In 2 years they are targeting to put over 50 youth through the local Njombe SINA program and generate nearly a dozen new enterprises as a result. 50% of these participants will be women and a further 15% will be people with disabilities. All participants will come from poverty based backgrounds.</p><p>To learn more of NIA milestones, their funding targets and to make a donation, visit <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Njombe-Innovation-Academy-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project on Giveth.io</a>.

In late 2020, two-and-a-half winters and many tents later, a next step in creating a path to housing for downtowners was conceived when the City of Olympia contracted a local design and build firm to create 60 ‘micro-houses’ to replace tents and offer more security and safety for those trying to get on their feet.“</p></blockquote><p>Following the successful construction and installation of these micro-houses, Art Is Solidarity will use additional funds raised to improve upon the amenities inside the Mitigation Site in a unique way. They are engaging the help of local artists to beautify the micro-houses into works of art and mint the art pieces into NFTs to be auctioned off digitally. Proceeds of these auctions will go towards outfitting the house with furniture, heaters and more!</p><p>Art Is Solidarity also intends to educate the shelter’s inhabitants and local artists about the vast opportunities that NFTs and cryptocurrencies can offer for alternative forms of income, and provide them with the tools to get involved.

This 5-acre beachfront paradise is where humans create strong ties with each other and the land while learning a wide range of skills for a harmonized lifestyle. These skills include permaculture, bamboo building, recycling techniques, holistic medicine, renewable energy, and healthy cooking techniques.</p><p>Founded in 2014 Finca Morpho is a place for curious travelers to spend time in nature and to fully immerse themselves in communal living. They also host events and retreats to further share the important knowledge they have cultivated on the farm. They have created closed-loop recycling systems from the ground up, having found ways to completely repurpose all of their waste. From a simple sandy beach they have nurtured a thriving permaculture system complete with aquaponics, soil sanctuaries and carbon sequestration techniques. They have come a long way from their humble beginnings.</p><p>There are 7 pillars that comprise the core physical and conceptual foundations of the farm: <strong>The Kitchen, The Resource Center, Permaculture, Hospitality, Infrastructure, Project Management and Relationships</strong>. Finca Morpho is seeking funding to upgrade a few of these pillars which need a bit of love in order to maintain and improve their functions. The four pillars needing improvements are:</p><ul><li><strong>Kitchen</strong> — To keep feeding hungry mouths and processing the bounty of the land. Buying new equipment such as blenders and stoves.</li><li><strong>Resource Center</strong> — To fulfill their mission of recycling or repurposing everything they use. Purchasing a 3d printer, plastic shredder, extruder, microscope and expanding the area of the center.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — The cabins, water storage system and solar grid they maintain are in need of love. Buying new solar batteries, renovating cabins and installing a new water storage system.</li><li><strong>Permaculture</strong> — Every season comes with new challenges and needs.

Shayan Eskandari, the project’s creator summarizes the opportunity to provide support:</p><blockquote><p>“Farsi is spoken by an estimated 110 million speakers mostly in Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Russia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan . . . In contrast to the West where computer engineers are predominantly men, Iran’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates are about 70% women.”</p></blockquote><p>CoinIran, the project’s host organization, has built opportunities to overcome these barriers by creating unique programs for Farsi speakers, notably their latest project, “Women in Blockchain’’. This program is putting Iranian women through the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer bootcamp while providing technical and linguistic support, giving them the knowledge and skills to acquire jobs as Ethereum developers. Their initial cycle put 7 women through the course, who all passed, receiving developer certifications from ConsenSys.</p><p><strong>Making Blockchain and Cryptocurrency more accessible will only help to ensure its growth and adoption.</strong> The project is seeking funding to cover the expenses of putting the women through the course and for the costs of building the course tailored for Farsi speakers with comprehensive media, translations and syllabuses.

In Vancouver the homeless population is ever-present and expanding. The temperate climate of southern BC has allowed this region to become a year-round hub for the Canadian demographic experiencing homelessness. The problem in Chilliwack is exacerbated as the city of Vancouver rounds up the homeless on one-way buses to Chilliwack, dropping them off in the town with no return.</p><p>Feeding the hungry is a simple and powerful gesture. David’s trusty team, consisting of him and his daughter, plans to create food packages to hand out to the population experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack.

Children will create the future of tomorrow and providing them with the means to succeed will help them overcome the challenges we still face today.</p><p>Vukani’s immediate goal is to grow food to nourish the local school children. Research is needed to find an agricultural system that works in the unique conditions of Zimbabwe.

The project’s creator, Mugisha, states that in rural Burundi up to <strong>58% of children suffer from malnutrition</strong> and communities often have no access to medical services. Agriculture and livestock can represent up to 95% of a village’s commercial activities, yet families still struggle to get enough food to sustain themselves.</p><p>PVC Burundi began in 2015 and is teaching rural communities how to implement regenerative systems for improving education, agriculture and healthcare. Activities focus on soil regeneration, organic waste recycling, tree planting, and of course, growing food. PVC Burundi provides healthcare access to communities in exchange for tree-planting services, incentivizing a healthy environment in tandem with healthy humans.</p><p>Food sold in markets via Village Communities are used to fund PVC’s healthcare and education initiatives. Every year they launch “Community Reconciliation” where they expose new communities to different regenerative techniques, begin tree planting campaigns and bring food to market. Currently, one of their main goals is to extend their healthcare facilities in Burundi.</p><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/CREATING-THE-PERFECT-VILLAGES-IN-BURUNDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Perfect Villages in Burundi</a> and help spread the regenerative movement in Africa!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bridging Digital Communities" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal2.png" class="img_ev3q"><h1>Bridging Digital Communities</h1><p>Is run by a Digital Wizard by the name of Kay. He creates online bridges that allow communities to stay connected. In the decentralized world of Blockchain, communities can spring up seemingly out of nowhere, forming around causes, concepts, technologies or protocols. In this rapidly growing part of the world wide web, communities thrive off of the collective innovation and synergy of ideas, exponentiated greatly by the digital bridges that Kay creates. He has been creating and maintaining bridge servers for applications such as Discord, Telegram or Riot and has never charged anyone to make these connections. He bridges quite a few notable Ethereum projects such as: Matic, Gitcoin, 1hive, Conensys, Aragon and even Giveth (Thanks Kay! 😉)</p><p>Kay has a project on Giveth — the proceeds of which go into funding the work he does building bridges and keeping digital communities connected. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Bridging-Digital-Communities-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out his project on Giveth here!</a></p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vegan Africa Fund" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal3.png" class="img_ev3q"><h1>Vegan Africa Fund</h1><p>Is a Social Enterprise focused on creating a vegan economy in Africa.

Wren Fialka, the founder, started it all by asking a man experiencing homelessness one question: “If there was a bag of items that I could bring you tomorrow to make your day-to-day life easier, what would be in the bag?”. Based on their simple approach focused on “Connection, Compassion and Vital Supplies” they have been serving communities across the US for the last 6 years.</p><p>On the Spread the Love project page they state that anywhere between 600,000 to 1.5 million people experience homelessness across the country, and with Covid-19 financial support ending soon, that number is likely to rise. With only one employee, Spread the Love Commission needs to grow in order to meet these rising challenges. So far they have served over 30 communities and with Giver support they hope to serve many more.</p><p>Spread the Love Commission aims to remove the stigma of homelessness and connect those stuck in a vicious cycle with support from those who are ready to offer it. With sustainability, compassion and persistence they hope to end the homelessness crisis once and for all.</p><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/spread-the-love-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit the Spread the Love Commission Giveth project page</a> to find out more and help them fund their critical mission!</p><p>And that’s a wrap!

It has been amazing to have the opportunity to learn from and highlight so many projects that are daring to be different, working hard to connect humans and improving the world we live in!</p><p>While the Change-Maker campaign has ended you can still get some <strong><em>Giveth love</em></strong> by sharing your project with us on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> for a shout out or a repost on our social media channels.
