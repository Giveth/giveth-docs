            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Giveth mission is to reward &amp; empower those who give — to projects, to society, and to the world. With GIVbacks, we’re rewarding givers by giving GIV to donors to verified projects on Giveth.</em></p><img loading="lazy" alt="what if giving gave back" src="/img/blog/GIVbackBanner.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>Web3 and, specifically, Ethereum have the potential to revolutionize the philanthropic space. We have the tools to open new funding streams and create economic abundance for everyone who is providing value to society.</p><p>Clean air, clear water, bridges, roads, free childcare, public education, taking care of the less fortunate — these are all examples of public goods that, when governments fail to provide them, we look to non-profits to create and care for. For funding, we have been relying on donors to give to these non-profits and receive nothing in return. Society has been depending on and <a href="https://youtu.be/PFy458wCQ0g?t=504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimately exploiting the altruists</a> who are working hard to protect and provide for our collective needs.</p><p><strong>GIVbacks is a paradigm shift for the donation space. For the first time ever, there is an economic upside to donating.</strong></p><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme1.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>GIVbacks is the first step towards a world in which everyone benefits from creating value: <strong>when you give to verified projects, 100% of your donation goes directly to the project, and you get</strong> <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/#about-giv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GIV</strong></a> <strong>from Giveth!</strong></p><p>With over 900 verified projects on Giveth, donors can find projects that speak to their values and get rewarded for giving. Verified projects benefit from the extra traffic on Giveth &amp; can use this program to attract new donors who are willing to support their initiatives.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture<a class="hash-link" href="#the-big-picture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Before we get into the fine details of exactly how the GIVbacks program works, let me walk you through the big picture that is the “why”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="projects-should-feel-good-about-raising-funds-for-their-project">Projects should feel good about raising funds for their project<a class="hash-link" href="#projects-should-feel-good-about-raising-funds-for-their-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Charity has traditionally created a dynamic where projects who do good work to benefit society have to beg for funds to make the world a better place. On the flip side, donors are being asked to sacrifice — to give without expecting anything in return.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme2.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>GIVbacks is changing that. Donors have the opportunity to support projects they believe in, get GIV in return, and start or increase their <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/givstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVstream</a>. They can use that GIV to grow their rewards by, for example, staking in the <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/givfarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVfarm</a>. It’s a win/win: Projects benefit from receiving 100% of the donation, and donors benefit by earning GIV and becoming part of the Giveth ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="givbacks-gives-governance-power-to-the-donors-using-giveth">GIVbacks gives governance power to the donors using Giveth<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-gives-governance-power-to-the-donors-using-giveth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme3.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>Giveth is of the donors, by the donors, and for the donors. <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our GIVdrop</a> was sent to the Blockchain4good community — <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and particularly crypto donors &amp; Giveth users</a> — because we wanted to kickstart the <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVeconomy</a> with value-aligned GIVers. Now, as the economy expands, we want the donors who are using the platform and giving to causes they care about to get proportionally increasing governance power. With GIVbacks, the more you give, the more GIV you get, and that GIV can be used in the <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/givgarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVgarden</a> to decide which proposals get funded to expand the GIVeconomy.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="givbacks-are-like-tax-deductible-donations-but-without-governments-and-borders">GIVbacks are like tax-deductible donations but without governments and borders<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-are-like-tax-deductible-donations-but-without-governments-and-borders" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme4.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>Let’s face it, tax-deductible donations can be a bit of a headache. Nonprofit projects have to cut through miles of red tape and donors have to do accounting each year, saving associated paperwork for some arbitrary number of years.</p><p>GIVbacks provides a similar end, but cuts the bureaucracy. If a project can prove they are legitimately adding value to society, they can become a verified project in the GIVbacks program, no matter what their legal or DAO structure is. If a donor is moved by a verified project’s work, they can give and receive GIV in return, no matter where (or if) they pay taxes. No need to save receipts or paperwork for fear of getting audited. Web3 makes it so that we don’t need governments and taxes to make this kind of system. We can transcend borders to connect people with projects anywhere in the world!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="givbacks-educates-community-members-about-web3">GIVbacks educates community members about web3<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-educates-community-members-about-web3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme5.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>The long-term vision of Giveth is to enable for-good projects to use token engineering and DAO coordination on the ground. GIVbacks is <a href="https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first step towards achieving this goal</a>. With GIVbacks, ordinary donors start learning about and getting curious about DAO tools like <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token streams</a>, <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givfarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeFi</a> and <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givgarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token-weighted voting</a>. Furthermore, when donors get GIV, they are naturally inclined to donate it! In GIVbacks round 1, 75% of the total value of donations to verified projects on our platform were in GIV.</p><p>With the GIVbacks program, both donors and projects receive GIV and start looking into how to grow their earnings, swiftly falling down the web3 rabbit hole via <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giv.giveth.io</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="givbacks-will-evolve-into-a-system-that-transforms-successful-projects-into-daos-and-donors-into-impact-investors">GIVbacks will evolve into a system that transforms successful projects into DAOs and donors into impact investors<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-will-evolve-into-a-system-that-transforms-successful-projects-into-daos-and-donors-into-impact-investors" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks meme" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksMeme6.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>GIVbacks as it is today is the first step on a path to expand Giveth into a place <a href="https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">where nonprofits can become microeconomies</a>. Next, we plan to introduce GIVcuration — a system where users can stake their GIV on projects they care about, signaling support while earning a yield. A successful project in the GIVcuration system will eventually be able to get its own GIV-collateralized <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-augmented-bonding-curve-part-1-a-web3-way-to-fund-public-goods-7c9d1a871ae2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bonding curve</a>, called a ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZiGlIm2vBs&amp;t=1093s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gurve</a>’.</p><p>When donors support a project with a Gurve, their GIVbacks get split: they get some GIV, and <a href="https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some GIV goes into the Gurve, minting the donor ‘project tokens’</a>, thereby increasing the price of the project tokens.</p><p>Before getting a Gurve, a project will need to set up a <a href="https://forum.tecommons.org/t/outlining-the-rewards-system-process-v2/646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewards system</a> to distribute their ‘reputation tokens’ to volunteers and on-the-ground supporters. When their Gurve is initialized, those reputation tokens turn into ‘project tokens’, and the project can use token-weighted voting systems to govern their donations.</p><p>With Gurves, a successful project on Giveth will be able to become a sustainable DAO, governing its own economy, with its supporters as stakeholders and donors as impact investors!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-fine-details">The Fine Details<a class="hash-link" href="#the-fine-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>So how exactly does this program work? Well, it makes use of a system for verifying projects on Giveth, and tracks donations to those projects in 2 week “rounds”. Let’s dig into the details.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="verified-projects">Verified Projects<a class="hash-link" href="#verified-projects" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>“Verified” is a seal of approval for legitimate projects on Giveth. Many Verified projects came pre-vetted from <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGivingBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Giving Block</a> API. The Giving Block is an organization that supports and onboards registered 501c3s from the United States into crypto, and with our integration you can donate to their projects from the Giveth UI.</p><p>For non-Giving Block projects, project owners need to fill out a <a href="https://giveth.typeform.com/verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typeform</a> and answer some questions. Verified Projects need to show that they are doing work to create <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/market-failure-and-the-role-of-government/externalities-topic/a/public-goods-cnx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-excludable</a> value for society and that they have some reputation at stake that would prevent them from gaming or manipulating the GIVbacks program for personal gain.</p><p>Our amazing Project Verification Team then reviews these applications, investigates the information provided &amp; informs the project owners about the verdict. Approved projects will have their Verified badges <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#project-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at the start of the very next GIVbacks round</a>. You can learn more about the project verification process and qualifying/disqualifying factors in our <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVbacks documentation</a>.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="verified badge" src="/img/blog/GivethIOdonateButton.png" class="img_E7b_"><p><strong>Getting your project verified builds a relationship of trust with your donors by demonstrating your project’s legitimacy and showing that the funds are being used to create positive change.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="givbacks-rounds">GIVbacks Rounds<a class="hash-link" href="#givbacks-rounds" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>GIVbacks rounds are 2 week periods wherein all donations to verified projects are tracked and recorded in our database. At the end of a round, our team reviews the donations and <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#getting-givbacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calculates the amount of GIV to send to each donor</a>. Note that recipient addresses of verified projects on Giveth do not get GIVbacks for their donations. This is to prevent recirculating funds and other fraudulent activity<strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>Once the distribution has been determined, and <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#disqualifying-factors-for-givbacks-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">any suspicious activity</a> has been resolved, <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-giveth-dao-community-givernance-84f55fa1ce36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reputation DAO token holders</a> vote to approve the allocation. You can see the votes to distribute GIVbacks for each round in our forum <a href="https://forum.giveth.io/tag/givbacks-distro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. When the vote passes, donors are notified via email that their GIVbacks are ready to claim <a href="https://giv.giveth.io/givbacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from the GIVbacks page</a>.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="givbacks round example" src="/img/blog/GIVbacksRoundExample.png" class="img_E7b_"><p><strong>Every 2 weeks, there is 1 million GIV available to give back to donors!</strong></p><p>Until December 23, 2026 donors who get GIV from GIVbacks are able to claim some part immediately upon distribution, and some part added to their <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIVstream flowrate</a>.

As in any good experiment, discoveries arose from these iterations and in October 2021, the rGIV DAO voted to retire the rGIV token in favor of creating a new instance (nrGIV) with several configuration changes, including the move from 1,111 to 1, ditching the extra digits.</p><p><strong><em>Also changed in this new rGIV DAO: the distribution of tokens now follows a Fibonacci sequence. This means that the number of tokens minted for each contributor in the latest period is equal to the sum of the two previous two periods.</em></strong></p><p>As shown, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOfficeMystic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dani</a> has been contributing since day 1. She earned 1 token to vote with the first period (1,111 — which was converted to 1 in the new simplified DAO), 2 tokens for the second period, 3 tokens the third period (because 1 + 2 = 3), and 5 tokens the fourth period (because 2 + 3 = 5). If she stops contributing there, she will retain her total balance of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11 nrGiv tokens for voting on governance proposals after the 4th period. If she continues consistently contributing to the Giveth Community, she will always have at least 1 token more than any contributors that came in later.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="the nrGIV DAO token holders" src="/img/blog/rgivDAOtokenHolders.png" class="img_E7b_"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/positonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a> is a co-founder of the rGIV DAO, and received tokens for periods 1, 2, and 3. He resigned during the 3rd period to focus on <a href="https://toucan.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toucan.earth</a>, and did not contribute during the 4th period, so does not qualify for the minting of 5 tokens. His voting weight remains at 6 tokens, while current contributors weight grows to 11. In this case where a past contributor does not return for 6 months and misses 2 full periods, their voting weight is now lower than a new contributor receiving nrGIV tokens during those two mintings.</p><p>So in this example, new contributors in periods 4 and 5 receive 8 tokens (3 + 5) bringing their total to 12 (5 + 8) — double that of James. When James returns, he will come in with his previous token weight and after another 3 months of contributions, qualifies to again receive nrGIV tokens.</p><p>In this way new contributors can gain as much influence as someone who has contributed in the prior two time periods, and over time the influence of past contributors is reduced after exiting the community. Behind this design is an assumption that those currently contributing can make the most informed vote about current governance of the organization. For consistent contributors who have been around from the beginning, those joining later will never reach or surpass your voting power, incentivizing retention of talent and wisdom for the community while incrementally fractionalizing the lead.</p><blockquote><p>Successful decentralized governance has been shown to require a healthy balance of new contributors being valued early, and long-time contributors valued for carrying the vital threads of vision, mission and information on the organization from past experience.</p></blockquote><p>Note: If you are on maternity or paternity leave, you still get the period’s token allocations during leave.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-is-the-nrgiv-token-used-for">What is the nrGIV token used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-nrgiv-token-used-for" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Voting on proposals that build the #FutureofGiving</strong></p><p>Anyone can make a proposal to the rGIV DAO, whether they are an nrGIV token holder or not.

Giveth follows a Sociocratic proposal-forming process by soliciting opinions and clarifying questions initially, then making revisions and polling for support via an Advice Process on our forum.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Previously hosted on</strong> <a href="https://www.loomio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Loomio</strong></a><strong>, you can see the proposal process</strong> <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/4TKQjvCg/configuring-giveth-dao-rep-token-on-aragon-1hive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>used to initiate the rGIV DAO</strong></a> <strong>here!</strong></p></blockquote><p>In 2021 Giveth revised its organizational structure into new Circles and Working Groups while launching a <a href="https://forum.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new proposal management method on Discourse</a>:</p><img loading="lazy" alt="the giveth forum" src="/img/blog/rgivDAOforum.png" class="img_E7b_"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="from-off-chain-advice-to-on-chain-voting">From Off-chain Advice to On-chain Voting<a class="hash-link" href="#from-off-chain-advice-to-on-chain-voting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>After a proposal has been reviewed, the champion (person writing and advocating for the proposal) can post a new Vote to the rGIV DAO! Once made, nrGIV token holders have 5 days to use their tokens and vote “yes” or “no”. Voting on each proposal in this DAO allocates your fully accrued nrGIV token quantity; and you do not lose them if you vote. In other words, if you have 7 tokens, and you vote “yes,” then 7 nrGIV tokens are added to the total “yes” votes while the tokens remain in your wallet. When you vote on other proposals, you still have 7 nrGIV tokens to vote on those as well.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Giveth Reputation DAO does not use Conviction Voting or require you to “stake” your reputation tokens — you never lose your tokens or have to choose which proposal to use them on; you always have the same number of tokens to vote with for each new proposal.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In order for a proposal to pass, it must have a majority of yes votes, and reach a “minimum approval” level, which we’ve set at 25%. If a proposal doesn’t have more than 25% of all minted tokens voting yes on it, it automatically does not pass regardless of the distribution of “yes” and “no” votes given. However, the proposal can always be proposed again and voted on again.</p><p>The second metric within each vote is the “Support” level. We have set that at 88%. If a vote reaches this level, it has more than the majority by a large margin and is labeled as having strong support. The third metric set by the DAO is “vote duration”; how much time must pass before voting is closed.</p><h1>Which Decisions Does the Giveth Reputation DAO Need to Vote on?</h1><p>The rGIV DAO has the responsibility for governing the GIVeconomy launch and our commons. This means that the assets built by the Giveth community and the funding received from donors to support Giveth are owned by the Community itself — the Givers and Makers contributing their skills, time, energy and resources to it. So deciding how to build the DApps, contract with individuals to fill roles on the team, and distribute funds to the Circles for maintaining operations and development of the open source code is a job for nrGIV token holders that collectively make up the rGIV DAO.</p><p>The road to decentralized governance has been paved with the bricks of this goodwill, and you can see again in Loomio how the Giveth Unicorn DAC used the Advice Process and voting to decide how to <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/Sbn1FeT7/285-eth-what-am-i-gonna-do-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allocate a 285 ETH gift in 2019</a>!</p><p>The Giveth Reputation DAO has the opportunity to do this again now as we contemplate allocation of the proceeds from <a href="https://medium.com/rainbow-rollup/nftps-rainbow-rolls-7a01d5eb1bb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow Rolls</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retropgf-experiment-1-1-million-dollars-for-public-goods-f7e455cbdca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Grant</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, what an exciting month it’s been since our last update. The crypto market is hitting all-time highs across the board, there’s no better time to spread the joy and make some donations to projects that are working hard to make positive changes.</p><img loading="lazy" id="resize50" alt="Project spotlight Time!" src="/img/blog/projectSpotlight4meme.jpeg" class="img_E7b_"><p>We’ve got another fresh batch of five projects that we’re featuring in this fourth edition of the Community Project Spotlight. But first, we’ve got some big news! 1Hive let the cat out of the bag and gave a sneak peek of the GIVeconomy launch. Tune-in to get the insider scoop on some of the details and the UI.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIhfmmGjT8g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p>Expect to hear more about the GIVeconomy in the coming weeks ;) Now let’s dive into some awesome projects that are live <a href="https://giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giveth.io</a>!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="UPF coin" src="/img/blog/UPFcoin.png" class="img_E7b_"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="upf-coin">UPF Coin<a class="hash-link" href="#upf-coin" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We all know plastic is a problem, its impact on the environment cannot be overstated. Untangling our relationship, as humans, with plastic will be one of the great challenges of our time. UPF Coin is a project by Unplastify which, as the name implies, is on a mission to put the brakes on our consumption of plastic. Unplastify is based out of Argentina and the USA, and provides a wide range of educational and practical activities promoting unplastification.</p><p>Their primary area of interest is the crippling effects of plastic waste in our oceans. To that end in 2018 they embarked on an epic oceanic adventure where the team took off on a sailboat named “Fanky” across the Atlantic and back, collecting plastic samples and researching impacts and alternatives to plastic. Their voyage took them from the ports of New York City all the way to Corsica and back across the pond to Buenos Aires, Argentina. You can check out more of the work unplastify does on <a href="https://www.unplastify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</p><p>The UPF Coin project introduces the powerful realities of blockchain and tokenization to their noble cause. At the heart of this lies a proprietary UPF blockchain which operates on a “proof of unplastify work” to distribute UPF coins. Every coin minted represents one tonne of avoided plastic consumption. Unplastification work done will be human validated by the UPF team. They plan to have a working blockchain and 25 UPF coins emitted by the end of this quarter! That’s 25 tonnes of plastic mitigated. Donations to their project will help them research and fund the deployment of the UPF token economy. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/upf-coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out UPF Coin on giveth.io</a> and make a donation!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Positive Blockchain" src="/img/blog/positiveBlockchain.png" class="img_E7b_"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="positive-blockchain">Positive Blockchain<a class="hash-link" href="#positive-blockchain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With an ever-increasing emergence of ‘blockchain-for-good’ projects, how can anyone keep up with all these amazing high vibes? Positive Blockchain is building the data-driven solution, having created the database for the blockchain-for-good universe. They maintain an impressive library of philanthropic blockchain project profiles that allow anyone to find projects working on causes they care about.</p><p>Positive Blockchain keeps track of the status of each project, whether they are in conception, began development or have already launched. From their <a href="https://pb.chainist.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact Dashboard</a> you can make a wide range of queries and see statistics of what projects are working on. They use the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> as part of the base metrics for querying projects. From the Social Impact Map you can see the distribution of blockchain-for-good projects worldwide.</p><p>They are asking for donations to expand their network of partners, maintain their databases and source out professional assistance in their tasks. If an excessive amount of funds are raised they will put them to expanding their network of projects in Africa.

The game-changing dynamics of blockchain are pervasive across an expansive list of modern industries. CineFi is introducing a platform to revolutionize funding and revenue streams from film-making.</p><p>The CineFi Network begins with artists submitting proposals for films they’re inspired to create. A CineFi token (CINE) will be the medium through which users can interact with proposals and films. Platform users can decide whether or not to invest funds (CINE) into bringing the film proposals into fruition. If the film reaches its funding goal a fractilized NFT is generated which represents proportional rights to creators and investors of the film, guaranteeing a cut of the revenues generated. The platform also allows users to stream or purchase these decentrally financed films with the same CINE tokens.</p><p>By this novel system, CineFi effectively allows for real-time community signalling for what films they want to see made. Thanks to Blockchain technology, creators and artists can more transparently navigate the terms on which they share revenues generated from their works. The blockchain becomes the final source of truth for where the fractalized NFTs are distributed, where funding comes from and where revenues go.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://cinefi.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CineFi website</a> we can hope to see film proposals rolling in by around mid-2022. Checkout <a href="https://giveth.io/project/cinefi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CineFi Network on giveth.io</a> to make a donation!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Good Work Foundation" src="/img/blog/goodWorkFoundation.png" class="img_E7b_"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="good-work-foundation">Good Work Foundation<a class="hash-link" href="#good-work-foundation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Access to modern education programmes in rural communities has always proved to be challenging; resources, budgeting and infrastructure all play a role. In Africa, these challenges create troubling disparities between populations. The Good Work Foundation (GWF) is focused on closing this gap and raising the bar. They have created a wide range of educational programmes with a focus on digital literacy. The programmes offered go from primary school students all the way to post-secondary specialized training for adults.</p><p>On Giveth, GWF is raising funds particularly for their Open Learning Academy programme, which focuses on young students in rural South Africa. On the project page they mention the staggering statistics they’re grappling with:</p><p><em>“In</em> <strong><em>rural South Africa</em></strong><em>, of 100 South African children that start school, approximately 60 will reach and write matric (high-school graduation exam), 37 will pass, and 12 will access university. This crippling problem will be even more exacerbated going into 2022.”</em></p><p>The programme intends to reach over 9,000 students from grade 4 to 8 in the municipality of Bushbuckridge in South Africa. The Open Learning Academy allows rural schools to outsource coding, robotics and digital literacy programmes to the GWF learning centre. The programme intends to support existing curriculums, rather than diverge from them, allowing participating children to build relevant skills to continue their education. You can learn more about GWF and their other programmes on <a href="https://www.goodworkfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.

DAOs represent not just a technological blockchain breakthrough, but also a cultural force to be reckoned with. DAOs in effect allow organizations to form organically and continually evolve, leaning on blockchain transparency and computer-aided governance systems. The technology we use to create DAOs is constantly iterating upon itself however we as humans remain as the constant base layer, “<strong><em>Layer 0</em></strong>”.</p><p>The DAOist is a DAO (aptly so) that intends to capture this social phenomenon and to incubate resulting ideas, collaboration and cultural practices. This takes form as live and virtual events held around existing events in the Ethereum community. They host conferences where DAO champions can come and share experience and knowledge and to build partnerships with other value-aligned communities.</p><p>Their first event was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBV5All5yM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris for EthCC4 in July of 2021</a>. It was a huge success and the people demanded more, so they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5aUHWDU7jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted a second one in Lisbon</a>, in October, of the same year. Their instant success has only proven that there’s a real desire to open up a space for DAOs to share and learn. To that end, they want to create educational spaces, physical and virtual, to empower DAOs. They are also in the process of defining their DAO structure. The DAOist is seeking funds in order to continue to host events and to create a year-round space for DAO enthusiasts to meet, collaborate and learn. Check out <a href="https://giveth.io/project/cofunding-the-daoist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project on giveth.io</a> to make a donation!</p><p>That’s a wrap for this one! Five projects shaking things up in our virtual and physical worlds. The digital realms being constructed are only becoming more ground-breaking and people are taking notice. Digital technology, particularly blockchain, is poised to revolutionize a wealth of domains, from education, arts, the environment, to even the fundamentals of how we organize.</p><p>Keep your eyes peeled for more details on the next phase of Giveth, it’s going to be BIG! Of course, we’ll have more projects to spotlight soon enough so <strong><em>watch this space</em></strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="want-to-get-more-involved">Want to get more involved?<a class="hash-link" href="#want-to-get-more-involved" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/JftjK8Un3z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> or <a href="http://t.me/givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram</a></li><li>Discover our <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docs</a></li><li>Fork our code on <a href="https://github.com/Giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us on <a href="http://medium.com/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClfutpRoY0WTVnq0oB0E0wQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></li></ul><p>Help us Build the Future of Giving: 🦄 <a href="http://donate.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donate directly</a> 🦄 or <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s?utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=d663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy a Ledger with our affiliate link</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

They are creating donation pathways to empower several native tribes, and are propagating holistic practices to restore our connection with the Earth. They currently support four tribal villages in the region:</p><ul><li><strong>Yawanawa — Shukuvena</strong> (“Toucan” in the local language) — Praised for fostering strong female leaders, this tribe is focused on agroforestry, food sovereignty, natural medicines and spiritual practices.</li><li><strong>Huni Kui — Pinuya</strong> (“Hummingbird” in the local language) — Residing in the northern zone of Acre, the village of Pinuya is making huge leaps in reforestation efforts and crop laying. They are focused on yielding saplings and food surpluses with the intention to move away from tourism and find alternative income sources.</li><li><strong>Huni Kui — Caucho</strong> — Dwelling in the basins of the rivers Juruà and Purus, the village of Caucho strives to reclaim their culture from the shocks of colonial industrialization. The Amazon Rubber Boom eroded much of their ancestral culture. They believe in sowing their culture through music, dance and art.</li><li><strong>Kuntanawa</strong> or “Coconut People” — Believe that plants are the way to connect with the spirits of the forest. They have mastered how to cure their people with traditional medicines and plan to cure the world by creating alliances of communities committed to restore the balance of nature.</li></ul><p>Each tribe boasts dozens of families living on their ancestral land, which collectively is spread out over hundreds of thousands of hectares of Amazonian rainforest. These peoples steward their land, implementing traditional agroforestry techniques, as well as ply their artisanal craft-making skills. The tribes affiliated with Futuro Nativo also host visitors and workshops to teach their culture to the curious and passionate.</p><p>Futuro Nativo has very well defined funding goals which complement each tribe’s unique needs and offerings. Visiting <a href="https://www.futuronativo.org/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>, you can see projects range from tree nurseries, educational events, to even creating online stores to distribute their artisanal crafts.

The Handshake Development (HNS) Fund is the community funding the Handshake protocol and affiliated systems. HNS at its core is a system for distributing internet domain names using cryptocurrency technology. The HNS protocol website hits home the need for better domain name distribution framework:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Names on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. . . . Services on the internet have become more centralized beginning in the 1990s, but do not fulfill the original decentralized vision of the internet. . . . Centralization exists because there is a need to manage spam, griefing, and sockpuppet/sybil attacks. Previous decentralized systems largely stopped working due to spam. If it were more costly to grief on the internet using decentralized systems, the need for trusted centralized corporations to manage these risks decrease.”</em></p></blockquote><p>HNS uses a token (aptly named HNS) to register domain names. Using these cryptographic tokens, participants can transfer and update their registered names. By creating a decentralized and accountable system, HNS (by way of its users) can inhibit a centralized actor from scooping up all the domain names. The HNS Fund seeks out donations to keep afloat their open-source tools, such as DNS records, domain registries, and educational content. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/handshake-development-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to support HNS public goods!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Njome Innovation Academy" src="/img/blog/NjombeIA.png" class="img_E7b_"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="njombe-innovation-academy">Njombe Innovation Academy<a class="hash-link" href="#njombe-innovation-academy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>is creating the next generation of African entrepreneurs in Njombe, Tanzania. Njombe Innovation Academy (NIA) is importing the Social Innovation Academy (SINA) educational model which began in Uganda. The premise of SINA is to invite members of marginalized african demographics with passion and ideas to a co-living experience to gain the entrepreneurial skills to make their dreams a reality. SINA has proven to be extremely successful, tackling prevailing African issues around failing education systems and corresponding unemployment rates. Njombe Innovation Academy profoundly lays out their <strong>Theory for Change</strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The desired impact (of NIA) is an increased number of social challenges tackled in Njombe by youth-led enterprises with locally available resources. . . . we will bootstrap a self-organised community of youth in Njombe who commonly owns(sic) and manages(sic) resources (material, knowledge, financial, social) to create social enterprises out of challenges . . . “</em></p></blockquote><p>SINA communities have been spreading around the continent and Uganda is ready, more than ever, for it’s own local SINA node. NIA identifies that local youth unemployment hovers around 10% with more than 40% never completing secondary school. Crippling rates of malnutrition and HIV hamper the societal and economic growth of Njombe.</p><p>Njombe Innovation Academy has outlined a clear plan for kick-starting the local SINA community. The first step is to send 3 local youth from Njombe to Uganda to gain insight from the original SINA. Then, with supporting members and facilities, these successful graduates begin to train subsequent cohorts of entrepreneurs. In 2 years they are targeting to put over 50 youth through the local Njombe SINA program and generate nearly a dozen new enterprises as a result. 50% of these participants will be women and a further 15% will be people with disabilities. All participants will come from poverty based backgrounds.</p><p>To learn more of NIA milestones, their funding targets and to make a donation, visit <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Njombe-Innovation-Academy-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project on Giveth.io</a>.

Meme Manifesto goes deep… deep, down the rabbit hole of memes as an ideological force and as a new medium of communicating complex, nuanced concepts. The project conveys itself as an amorphous transmedia project that will take various forms at various points of its evolution. The Manifesto itself expresses powerful reflections on meme culture:</p><blockquote><p><em>“. . . we believe memes to be the latest iteration of the one true power that defines us as a species: the faculty to understand, interpret and alter our reality through linguistic and symbolic patterns of meaning. To understand this power means to hold the keys to control the uncertain grounds on which our common social world is constructed.”</em></p></blockquote><img loading="lazy" alt="Meme Manifesto" src="/img/blog/memeManifesto2.png" class="img_E7b_"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="a-snapshot-of-what-to-expect-among-the-depths-of-the-meme-iceberg">A snapshot of what to expect among the depths of the “meme iceberg”<a class="hash-link" href="#a-snapshot-of-what-to-expect-among-the-depths-of-the-meme-iceberg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>On the <a href="https://mememanifesto.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meme Manifesto we bsite</a> you can embark on a journey through the meme-sphere beginning from the nascent forms of memery, into the depths of niche cultural references and intricate memeified expressions.

Utilizing music, culture, and art they have mobilized hands to create and maintain localized nodes of permaculture in over 65 cities for the last 5 years. In more concrete terms, this is executed via <strong>Permaculture Action Days;</strong> an event which organizes various activities including workshops and discussion panels, often in partnership with local music festivals or cultural events. During the event, participants are channeled to aid in the construction of permaculture infrastructure, such as community gardens, rainwater catchment systems and greenhouses.</p><p>The heart of activity during the event is the <strong>Permaculture Action Hub</strong>. This is the physical place which brings in curious festival attendees to learn a wide variety of subjects, ranging from alternative economies to mushroom cultivation.</p><p>Also featured during Action Days are <strong>Permaculture Action Courses</strong>. These  are free, hands-on classes that teach regenerative ecological techniques and socio-economic structures for individuals and communities.</p><p>Adapting to the pandemic, the Permaculture Action Network has begun building their next interactive tool: the Just Transition Map. This map will show locations of community spaces and projects that are creating better alternatives to the current extractive economy. This will be a tool for the global environmental justice movement to coordinate and create action. Donations to Permaculture Action Network will help them build the Just Transition Map and to allow the network’s programs to persist through the pandemic.

This is also an extra special spotlight because Giveth.io itself is currently active and accepting donations on the latest round of <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gitcoin Grants</strong></a> <strong>(GR11)</strong>. If you feel inspired by the Giveth mission after reading this article then consider making a contribution via our <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/795/givethio-panvala-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grants listing</a> and learn about the magic of <em>Quadratic Funding</em>! More on that later…</p><img loading="lazy" alt="GR11 Magic" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2Cover.gif" class="img_E7b_"><p>Without further ado let’s dive in and highlight these projects that are making our DApp great!  </p><hr><img loading="lazy" alt="ETHOS" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-1.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1><strong>ETHOS</strong></h1><p><strong>Emergency Transitional Housing Offering Services (ETHOS)</strong> is designing funding solutions for the homelessness crisis in Olympia, Washington State. ETHOS has been championed by ‘Art Is Solidarity’ which is a local non-profit combining blockchain technology and art mediums to find solutions and funding opportunities for pressing social issues. At the heart of this project is the city’s first initiative: to combat homelessness. From ETHOS’s project description:</p><blockquote><p>“In 2018, the City of Olympia sanctioned a tent city adjacent to the transit center downtown dubbed the “Mitigation Site” for those struggling on the streets to have somewhere to rest and seek shelter. In late 2020, two-and-a-half winters and many tents later, a next step in creating a path to housing for downtowners was conceived when the City of Olympia contracted a local design and build firm to create 60 ‘micro-houses’ to replace tents and offer more security and safety for those trying to get on their feet.“</p></blockquote><p>Following the successful construction and installation of these micro-houses, Art Is Solidarity will use additional funds raised to improve upon the amenities inside the Mitigation Site in a unique way. They are engaging the help of local artists to beautify the micro-houses into works of art and mint the art pieces into NFTs to be auctioned off digitally. Proceeds of these auctions will go towards outfitting the house with furniture, heaters and more!</p><p>Art Is Solidarity also intends to educate the shelter’s inhabitants and local artists about the vast opportunities that NFTs and cryptocurrencies can offer for alternative forms of income, and provide them with the tools to get involved. Check out their <a href="https://giveth.io/project/ETHOS-Emergency-Transitional-Housing-Offering-Services-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Giveth.io</a> and donate to help the build and beautification of micro-housing, and the educational opportunities being created for the homeless in Olympia.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Finca Morpho" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-2.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Finca Morpho</h1><p>Nestled in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, there is a community of thriving nomads building ecological harmony at Finca Morpho. This 5-acre beachfront paradise is where humans create strong ties with each other and the land while learning a wide range of skills for a harmonized lifestyle. These skills include permaculture, bamboo building, recycling techniques, holistic medicine, renewable energy, and healthy cooking techniques.</p><p>Founded in 2014 Finca Morpho is a place for curious travelers to spend time in nature and to fully immerse themselves in communal living. They also host events and retreats to further share the important knowledge they have cultivated on the farm. They have created closed-loop recycling systems from the ground up, having found ways to completely repurpose all of their waste. From a simple sandy beach they have nurtured a thriving permaculture system complete with aquaponics, soil sanctuaries and carbon sequestration techniques. They have come a long way from their humble beginnings.</p><p>There are 7 pillars that comprise the core physical and conceptual foundations of the farm: <strong>The Kitchen, The Resource Center, Permaculture, Hospitality, Infrastructure, Project Management and Relationships</strong>. Finca Morpho is seeking funding to upgrade a few of these pillars which need a bit of love in order to maintain and improve their functions. The four pillars needing improvements are:</p><ul><li><strong>Kitchen</strong> — To keep feeding hungry mouths and processing the bounty of the land. Buying new equipment such as blenders and stoves.</li><li><strong>Resource Center</strong> — To fulfill their mission of recycling or repurposing everything they use. Purchasing a 3d printer, plastic shredder, extruder, microscope and expanding the area of the center.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — The cabins, water storage system and solar grid they maintain are in need of love. Buying new solar batteries, renovating cabins and installing a new water storage system.</li><li><strong>Permaculture</strong> — Every season comes with new challenges and needs. Purchasing seeds, plants and trees.</li></ul><p>Check out <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Finca-Morpho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finca Morpho’s project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to keep this community thriving and capable of spreading its message to those who seek it, and learn more about how they do it on their <a href="https://www.fincamorpho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Solidity Development Course in Farsi" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-3.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Solidity Development Course in Farsi</h1><p>The language and gender barriers created by the english-dominated blockchain industry severely hamper opportunities of up-and-coming demographics to fully participate in the revolutionary technology that Blockchain produces. Shayan Eskandari, the project’s creator summarizes the opportunity to provide support:</p><blockquote><p>“Farsi is spoken by an estimated 110 million speakers mostly in Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Russia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan . . . In contrast to the West where computer engineers are predominantly men, Iran’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates are about 70% women.”</p></blockquote><p>CoinIran, the project’s host organization, has built opportunities to overcome these barriers by creating unique programs for Farsi speakers, notably their latest project, “Women in Blockchain’’. This program is putting Iranian women through the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer bootcamp while providing technical and linguistic support, giving them the knowledge and skills to acquire jobs as Ethereum developers. Their initial cycle put 7 women through the course, who all passed, receiving developer certifications from ConsenSys.</p><p><strong>Making Blockchain and Cryptocurrency more accessible will only help to ensure its growth and adoption.</strong> The project is seeking funding to cover the expenses of putting the women through the course and for the costs of building the course tailored for Farsi speakers with comprehensive media, translations and syllabuses. Further funds raised will allow more women to go through the program.

It is the intelligence of nature as expressed through human thought and action.”</em>. The word is derived from the Greek word <strong><em>Oikos</em></strong>, meaning “home”. The project, Oika, is reconnecting humans with nature and raising awareness of climate change through NFT technology. Dr. Rich Blundell, the project’s creator, has gathered a team of scientists, artists and storytellers to cultivate <em>Ecological Intelligence</em>. They are combining the realms of academic ecological analysis with different artistic techniques to produce images and videos that are minted as NFTs. You can check out their creations on the <a href="https://oika.com/oika-media-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oika Media page</a>.</p><p>Oika also maintains an off-grid homestead and marine research vessel for inspired researchers to collaborate, incubating new ideas and generating knowledge. There are a wide variety of subjects that Oika advocates research on, such as:</p><ul><li>Ecological Survey &amp; Monitoring</li><li>Invasive Species Response</li><li>Pelagic/Neritic, Plastics Clean-up</li><li>Fishing Debris Location &amp; Removal</li><li>Wildlife Reporting &amp; Monitoring</li><li>Aquaculture Research</li><li>Phenology (study of climate change effects)</li><li>Citizen Science</li><li>Sci-Art Collaboration</li><li>Public Interpretation/Communication</li><li>Conservation Journalism/Documentary</li></ul><p>Oika also offers courses for teaching the concepts of Ecological Intelligence.

Grassroots Economics is proving this concept by building open-source economies in communities throughout Kenya. Their base token. known as Community Inclusion Currency (CIC). is to be used across all their participating communities in order to quantify and redistribute the abundance of goods they produce.</p><p>Their vision is to create healthy and decentralized ecosystems by empowering locals to design their own economies. They also believe heavily in syntropic agroforestry as the main technique to provide agricultural abundance and economic value production.</p><p>They seek funding in order to build the open-source software they need in order to achieve their goals.

Rainbow Crystal Land (RCL), established in 2014, strives to create a global network of leaderless, horizontally structured communities that live in harmony with each other and the Earth. Currently they operate out of their main hub in San Agustin but are seeking to build a global community that shares their philosophy. They are mostly donation based but also sell the food they grow on the land to the local markets. All of these funds go into their “Magic Hat” which is used to buy necessary food and pay overhead costs to continue their existence.</p><p>They have written a <a href="https://rainbowcrystal.land/document/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive handbook</a> detailing many aspects of their organization, including their declaration of Common Intention as well as their Mission, Vision and Values. On the land they maintain several houses for families and dormitories for their human inhabitants. They operate a solar grid for closed-loop electricity provision and also a permaculture farm on their 14 hectare plot of land.</p><p>RCL is seeking funding to improve much of their existing infrastructure. They are hoping to purchase treated bamboo and other wood to finish building their housing projects. Tools and plant supplies need to be bought to begin putting to use their recently acquired land. Funding also is always needed to feed their citizens, namely, those who are working hard to build their utopian vision.

They provide resources for disaster relief workers and environmental conservationists. The biodiversity contained in Costa Rica cannot be understated and the preservation of the plethora of unique flora and fauna in this region is paramount to the Multiversity’s mission. They currently steward a land area of 1235 acres located within the Barra del Colorado National Refuge which has been designated by UNESCO as one of most important places for natural conservation.</p><p>Currently, Colorado Multiversity operates out of a biological station called “El Zota”, which is one of the Multiversity’s partners. El Zota carries out research and training for those who are passionate about conservation and biodiversity. There is also The Refuge Project, another one of the Multiversity’s organizations, that utilizes the facility as a safe space for disaster relief workers worldwide to meet, rest, teach and learn.</p><p>The Colorado Multiversity has been recognized by some notable organizations for potential funding, including the SDG Impact Fund, Gaia Gives and the Spanish Cooperation. They are seeking initial funding to kick-start their mission and meet the funding criteria outlined by these organizations. They have a wide range of projects being launched including decarbonization initiatives, international volunteering programs, agricultural development research and plastic recycling.

In Vancouver the homeless population is ever-present and expanding. The temperate climate of southern BC has allowed this region to become a year-round hub for the Canadian demographic experiencing homelessness. The problem in Chilliwack is exacerbated as the city of Vancouver rounds up the homeless on one-way buses to Chilliwack, dropping them off in the town with no return.</p><p>Feeding the hungry is a simple and powerful gesture. David’s trusty team, consisting of him and his daughter, plans to create food packages to hand out to the population experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack. David is seeking funding to purchase ingredients for the food packages, cover gas costs and pay for lodging expenses. At the time of writing this article, David’s team is gearing up and getting ready to execute their plan in the coming weeks. Funds contributed to this project will allow them to scale their mission and feed more people. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Feed-the-Hungry-in-Chilliwack-BC-Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a>, make a donation and stay tuned for updates in the near future!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight3.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)</h1><p>Have launched an inclusive community to celebrate, support and connect the women in the crypto art space. The voices of women are extremely important and often underrepresented so WOCA is championing the presence of women in the crypto sphere. They share ideas and information and promote each other’s work across all realms of cryptocurrency. In 6 short months their community has quickly grown to over 400 members.</p><p>WOCA has kept pace with their rapid growth, improving their organization in many ways. They’ve built a website to showcase their community talent, they launched a Colony DAO to manage their thriving tribe and have formed great relationships with entities such as Panvala and Cryptovoxels. WOCA is seeking funding to reach their next milestones, including building a permanent gallery, onboarding members to the DAO and promoting all of the incredible work done by women artists.

The entire country faces extreme food security challenges, driven by political and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to finding food security solutions for one of the most important, yet vulnerable groups in society: the children. The project’s owner, Tim Olsson, believes that satisfying the nutritional needs of children allows them to focus on their education and development. Children will create the future of tomorrow and providing them with the means to succeed will help them overcome the challenges we still face today.</p><p>Vukani’s immediate goal is to grow food to nourish the local school children. Research is needed to find an agricultural system that works in the unique conditions of Zimbabwe. Once an effective system is found by the initial pilot project, their aim is to scale up and one day serve the entire country. Progress has been made for finding a water source but more infrastructure needs to be acquired to effectively distribute it for irrigation. Funds to this project will help make purchases for water pumps and solar-powered irrigation systems.

MyCrypto also allows you to deploy and carry out direct interactions with Ethereum smart contracts! Neato! Apart from those wonderful tools, it can also facilitate sending, requesting, swapping and buying crypto as well as tracking eligible airdrops. They also have a desktop app for offline wallet management, useful for managing private keys and seed phrases.</p><p>MyCrypto is open-source and has developed many free tools for Ethereum user security, such as a <a href="https://cryptoscamdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database for tracking known crypto scams</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a web extension for preventing phishing attempts</a> and an <a href="https://findeth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">application for finding lost Ethereum addresses</a>.

Harnessing the knowledge of Syntropic Farming they have launched their project along the lush rural roads of Costa Rica. According to Devin &amp; Arthur, Free the Food’s co-founders, Syntropic Farming is the gateway to restoring ecological diversity, creating wildlife habitats and holistically super-charging the generation of delicious and healthy food.</p><p>They have already begun with three streetside syntropic plantations to grow food, with more sites on the way. Their grand vision is to create a network of streetside syntropics and to engineer a grants system allowing new communities to spring up, acquiring the knowledge to begin propagating these regenerative food sources. They are seeking funding now to develop their website and purchase irrigation tools, water tanks, seeds, tools, as well as to provide a monthly budget for 1 employee. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/free-the-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth</a> and learn more about Free the Food!</p><p>There you have it!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>We are pleased to announce the official full release of</em></strong> <a href="http://trace.giveth.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=traceLaunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Giveth TRACE</em></strong></a> <strong><em>— a platform for traceable, accountable, effective donations powered by blockchain technology.</em></strong></p><img loading="lazy" alt="Giveth TRACE homepage" src="/img/blog/traceLaunchCover.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>In the <a href="/blog/futureOfGiving2017">early stages</a> of Giveth, we set out to demystify philanthropic contributions to nonprofits by empowering Givers with the ability to see where and how their donations are being used. We released our MVP DApp in 2018 to be beta tested by the Giveth Galaxy, but faced huge obstacles. Scope creep, maintenance of a complex system, and an overly complicated user experience prevented a quick release, and then we simply ran out of funding. We were close to “calling it quits” on our original DApp in favour of a simpler, <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user-friendly version</a> that we would design from scratch.</p><p>Fortunately for Givers everywhere, our all-star devs refused to give up. We assembled a team around the DApp and worked tirelessly for months on stabilization and beautification. With our hearts full of joy and our hats in our hands, we are proud to finally come out of beta and release TRACE to the world.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="giveth-trace-is-no-longer-a-wistful-dream-of-something-that-could-have-been--its-a-reality"><strong>Giveth TRACE is no longer a wistful dream of something that could have been — it’s a reality!</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-trace-is-no-longer-a-wistful-dream-of-something-that-could-have-been--its-a-reality" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Allow us to proudly present a platform that lifts the veil between Givers and their donations in action. A platform that empowers projects to create highly customizable online representations to attract real supporters. A platform that emphasizes the development of trust between all parties — the Givers, the projects and the greater community. We proudly present: <a href="http://trace.giveth.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=traceLaunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth TRACE</a>.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Memery - Traceable Donations" src="/img/blog/traceLaunchMeme1.jpeg" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Project Verification</h1><img loading="lazy" class="leftfloat" width="250" height="auto" alt="Verified Project Badge" src="/img/blog/traceLaunchPhoto1.png"><p>Givers using TRACE know that their donations are going to top-quality legitimate projects thanks to our project verification system. In order to add a project as a Campaign on Giveth TRACE, a Maker must first add their project to <a href="http://giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giveth.io</a> and apply to become verified. Currently this process is informal, but soon it will be integrated into the project flow. For now, if you want to verify your project, fill <a href="https://hlfkiwoiwhi.typeform.com/to/pXxk0HO5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out this typeform</a> and reach out in the #project-onboarding channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/nVSbGSHaaD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p><h1>Accountability</h1><p>Campaigns represent the big picture for each project — projects use Campaigns to collect traceable donations and manage them transparently. Under each Campaign there can be multiple “<a href="/dapps/leavingTraces">Traces</a>”, i.e. payments, bounties, or expenses. Traces specify how the project is using their donations to achieve the goals of the overarching Campaigns. When a Giver donates to a Campaign they can follow the flow of their donations. Whenever donations are moved from a Campaign to a Trace, the Giver is notified and can see exactly how their donations are used.</p><p>Traces are the only way for donations to leave Giveth TRACE. Every project on the platform will have to explain how they are using the donations before collecting them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="this-way-the-campaigns-are-held-accountable-to-the-givers-and-the-givers-can-see-their-donations-in-action"><strong>This way, the Campaigns are held accountable to the Givers and the Givers can see their donations in action!</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#this-way-the-campaigns-are-held-accountable-to-the-givers-and-the-givers-can-see-their-donations-in-action" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><img loading="lazy" alt="TRACE campaign page" src="/img/blog/traceLaunchPhoto2.png" class="img_E7b_"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="campaigns-live-on-giveth-trace">Campaigns Live on <a href="https://www.trace.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth TRACE</a><a class="hash-link" href="#campaigns-live-on-giveth-trace" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><h1>Donor Empowerment</h1><p>Not sure which Campaign to donate to? Giveth TRACE also offers “Communities”, which represent people and projects united by common goals and initiatives. When you donate to a Community, you are donating to a cause that you believe in! <a href="/dapps/entitiesAndRoles">Communities can delegate donations to Campaigns or to specific Traces</a>, and each time donations are delegated, the Giver can choose to veto the movement.</p><p>In this way, Giveth TRACE builds on blockchain technology with an added layer of donor empowerment that has never before been possible. <strong>Givers don’t have to trust that their donations are flowing to projects they believe in, they can actively ensure it.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="but-wait--theres-more">But wait — there’s more…<a class="hash-link" href="#but-wait--theres-more" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h1>Free Gas for Giveth TRACE Projects</h1><img loading="lazy" alt="Memery - Free gas, gas station" src="/img/blog/traceLaunchMeme3.jpeg" class="img_E7b_"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="on-giveth-trace-giveth-pays-the-gas-fees-so-projects-dont-have-to">On Giveth TRACE, Giveth pays the gas fees so projects don’t have to!<a class="hash-link" href="#on-giveth-trace-giveth-pays-the-gas-fees-so-projects-dont-have-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Giveth TRACE makes use of two networks in order to address security and scalability issues. Our use of Rinkeby testnet <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">makes it free to perform basic site interactions</a>, such as creating a Trace, managing donations, or updating a profile. However, in order to collect or disburse donations from a Trace, <a href="/dapps/bridgeSecurity/">Ethereum gas fees must still be paid</a> to get the donations to the final recipient on mainnet. We are excited to financially support each project on Giveth TRACE while also protecting them from the difficult user experience and the complications of the Ethereum network, so we cover their gas costs!</p><p>You can see the total gas Giveth paid for each Campaign, Trace or Individual on TRACE — and can even share it with your friends.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Memery - Traceable Donations" src="/img/blog/traceLaunchPhoto4.png" class="img_E7b_"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="total-gas-paid-for-the-commons-stack-community-campaign-on-giveth-trace">Total Gas Paid for the <a href="https://www.trace.giveth.io/campaign/commons-stack-community-iteration-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commons Stack Community Campaign</a> on Giveth TRACE<a class="hash-link" href="#total-gas-paid-for-the-commons-stack-community-campaign-on-giveth-trace" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>Our mission at Giveth is to bridge the non-profit and blockchain worlds, connecting people, ideas and resources with free, open source decentralized applications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Giveth has been buzzing with action! While we’ve been hard at work behind-the-scenes building for our community, Giveth change-makers have been hard at work creating positive impact on the ground. We are excited to share with you one final round-up of projects in the Change-Maker Campaign.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Change Makers Going out to pasture" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinalCover.jpeg" class="img_E7b_"><p>Our <a href="/blog/changeMakers">Calling All Change-Makers Campaign</a> launched in April 2021 as a way to highlight the unique stories of for-good projects on Giveth and bring extra attention to the work that they are doing to change the world for the better. Read on to discover the final submissions!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Perfect Village Communities (PVC) in Burundi" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal1.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Perfect Village Communities (PVC) in Burundi</h1><p>Is an organization that aims to improve the living conditions in rural communities across the central African country of Burundi. The project’s creator, Mugisha, states that in rural Burundi up to <strong>58% of children suffer from malnutrition</strong> and communities often have no access to medical services. Agriculture and livestock can represent up to 95% of a village’s commercial activities, yet families still struggle to get enough food to sustain themselves.</p><p>PVC Burundi began in 2015 and is teaching rural communities how to implement regenerative systems for improving education, agriculture and healthcare. Activities focus on soil regeneration, organic waste recycling, tree planting, and of course, growing food. PVC Burundi provides healthcare access to communities in exchange for tree-planting services, incentivizing a healthy environment in tandem with healthy humans.</p><p>Food sold in markets via Village Communities are used to fund PVC’s healthcare and education initiatives. Every year they launch “Community Reconciliation” where they expose new communities to different regenerative techniques, begin tree planting campaigns and bring food to market. Currently, one of their main goals is to extend their healthcare facilities in Burundi.</p><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/CREATING-THE-PERFECT-VILLAGES-IN-BURUNDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Perfect Villages in Burundi</a> and help spread the regenerative movement in Africa!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bridging Digital Communities" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal2.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Bridging Digital Communities</h1><p>Is run by a Digital Wizard by the name of Kay. He creates online bridges that allow communities to stay connected. In the decentralized world of Blockchain, communities can spring up seemingly out of nowhere, forming around causes, concepts, technologies or protocols. In this rapidly growing part of the world wide web, communities thrive off of the collective innovation and synergy of ideas, exponentiated greatly by the digital bridges that Kay creates. He has been creating and maintaining bridge servers for applications such as Discord, Telegram or Riot and has never charged anyone to make these connections. He bridges quite a few notable Ethereum projects such as: Matic, Gitcoin, 1hive, Conensys, Aragon and even Giveth (Thanks Kay! 😉)</p><p>Kay has a project on Giveth — the proceeds of which go into funding the work he does building bridges and keeping digital communities connected. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Bridging-Digital-Communities-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out his project on Giveth here!</a></p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vegan Africa Fund" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal3.png" class="img_E7b_"><h1>Vegan Africa Fund</h1><p>Is a Social Enterprise focused on creating a vegan economy in Africa. They actively support African ventures in education, regenerative agriculture, renewable-energy cryptocurrency mining, vegan leather and clothing, reforestation and making delicious vegan food! They have minted their own digital $VAF impact-tokens which are accepted by all of their affiliate businesses for any products, services and experiences they might offer.

Wren Fialka, the founder, started it all by asking a man experiencing homelessness one question: “If there was a bag of items that I could bring you tomorrow to make your day-to-day life easier, what would be in the bag?”. Based on their simple approach focused on “Connection, Compassion and Vital Supplies” they have been serving communities across the US for the last 6 years.</p><p>On the Spread the Love project page they state that anywhere between 600,000 to 1.5 million people experience homelessness across the country, and with Covid-19 financial support ending soon, that number is likely to rise. With only one employee, Spread the Love Commission needs to grow in order to meet these rising challenges. So far they have served over 30 communities and with Giver support they hope to serve many more.</p><p>Spread the Love Commission aims to remove the stigma of homelessness and connect those stuck in a vicious cycle with support from those who are ready to offer it. With sustainability, compassion and persistence they hope to end the homelessness crisis once and for all.</p><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/spread-the-love-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit the Spread the Love Commission Giveth project page</a> to find out more and help them fund their critical mission!</p><p>And that’s a wrap! Thank you to all the Givers that provide support to projects that are making a difference, and to all the change-makers that are finding a way to make positive global impact. It has been amazing to have the opportunity to learn from and highlight so many projects that are daring to be different, working hard to connect humans and improving the world we live in!</p><p>While the Change-Maker campaign has ended you can still get some <strong><em>Giveth love</em></strong> by sharing your project with us on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> for a shout out or a repost on our social media channels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Upholding our values of Transparency and Accountability by sharing recent development updates from this past sprint.</em></p><p>In this past sprint, we worked out the kinks on our <strong>rich text editor</strong>, allowing Makers to add photos, videos, numbered lists, font styles, headers and more to project descriptions and updates! This should be ready to go on <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giveth.io</a> this week. If you’re a project owner, be sure to log-on and update your description to get potential Givers even more excited about what you’ve been up to.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rich Text Editor Embedded in Create-a-Project" class="center" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening3img1.png"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="rich-text-editor-embedded-in-create-a-project">Rich Text Editor Embedded in Create-a-Project<a class="hash-link" href="#rich-text-editor-embedded-in-create-a-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>We also spent some time optimizing the presentation of our Dapp for Mobile, fixing some visual inconsistencies and improving overall usability. We improved upon our email notifications, ensuring that Givers and Makers receive confirmation when a donation is made.</p><p>We developed and implemented automated testing for the create-a-project flow and updated the <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/docs/testing-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing guidelines</a> in our documentation — two measures to ensure that new features work as intended.</p><p>We also addressed a few bugs: ensured that cancelled projects don’t show up in the projects list, fixed pricing, and rerouted external links for xDai donations to blockscout.</p><p>One of our all-star developers also surprised us this past sprint with a proof of concept: building Giveth.io using Next.js and Vercel instead of Gatsby and Netlify. Once we make sure all our functionality is bug-free, this change will drastically improve the UX. We’re talking faster site build, fewer issues on loading and updating, and an overall snappier site experience.</p><p>In the future, we’re going to be enhancing the UI so Makers will be able to upload photos via Unsplash when editing or creating a project. We are in the process of updating our Join, About, Contact and Support sections to the most recent info. We are also still working on the integration of an embedded chat bridged directly to our team, and project/profile verification using 3box or other.</p><p>Finally, the most exciting update to share is that we are working on giving the site a little makeover. We won’t give too much away, but here’s a little sneak peak of the new design:</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Working on a New Look for Giveth.io" class="center" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening3img2.jpg"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="working-on-a-new-look-for-givethio">Working on a New Look for Giveth.io<a class="hash-link" href="#working-on-a-new-look-for-givethio" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>We want to extend a huge thank you to our community for all your support so far!

It’s been an exciting couple of months for Giveth. We’ve come hot off the heels from the Giveth.io launch right into this opportunity to hear about projects making a difference across the globe. We’ve received <strong>six outstanding submissions</strong> that we would like to highlight in our first roundup. Without further ado here they are!</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="sage-to-saddle"><strong>Sage to Saddle</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#sage-to-saddle" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>aims to focus Native American youth on healthy lifestyle alternatives, rising above the poverty and substance abuse that they often live with. Nate Bressler realized while on photo-assignment shooting Native American horse racing teams for Outside Magazine, that a winter horse riding facility would greatly benefit the community of Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He teamed up with Lakota Native, Stan Brewer, the driving force behind Pine Ridge’s horse community and Angela Smith, who grew up in Utah and has been involved in nonprofits her whole life. Together, they created lofty but attainable goals that will bring structure, education, celebration, along with the opportunity for these Native youth to lift their chins with pride.</p><p>This project hopes to provide an after-school program for kids 8–18 focused on equine relationships in an indoor horse riding arena. Students of the program will be granted the opportunity to learn and grow while carrying on a traditional relationship with the very animal that made their ancestors’ survival possible. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/sage-to-saddle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Sage to Saddle on Giveth here!</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conscious-medicine-collective"><strong>Conscious Medicine Collective</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#conscious-medicine-collective" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>dreams to create a one-of-a-kind psychedelic consciousness center. Manex Ibar and Victoria Ibar, partners and founders, intend to create powerful experiences to bring together creativity, music, art, and high-end healing. The intention is to gather medical practitioners and influencers together into a club that fosters innovation, problem solving, and creative solutions through the use of plant medicines, psychedelics, and consciousness programs. They seek funding to establish their center on 12 acres of land they already have purchased in the picturesque Basque Pyrenées. Conscious Medicine Collective aims to bring magic, nature and wonder into an experiential club center that provides elevation of consciousness. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/conscious-medicine-collective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venture over to their Giveth project page.</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="trust-graphic-novel"><strong>Trust Graphic Novel</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#trust-graphic-novel" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>is a transmedia project by Blockchain Philanthropy Champion Anne Connelly and accomplished artist and storyteller Chief Nyamweya. Both a graphic novel and motion comic, it is set in a future African nation that tells the story of Moraa, a young woman who learns about blockchain and uses it to protect her homeland from cultural and ecological destruction. By using storytelling to educate readers about blockchain technology, they hope to inspire African youth to see a bright future and link them to the training to create it. Currently Anne and her team are partnered with groups in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. The book will cover the basics of blockchains and cryptocurrency, and provide resources and links to their African-based educational partners. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/trust-graphic-novel-and-motion-comic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can find their Giveth project here.</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="bloom-network"><strong>Bloom Network</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bloom-network" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>represents an international community of people and projects working toward regenerative cultures. Local Bloom hubs around the world grow participation in practices such as food security, local economies, celebrations of diversity, and art as cultural transformation. There are tens of thousands of initiatives solving major social and environmental problems, who are excluded from mainstream media and institutional finance because the way they work is naturally collaborative and polycentric. Three big picture goals the Bloom Network hopes to achieve are:</p><ul><li>Inspire a billion acts of regeneration.</li><li>Build capacity and relationships across regenerative culture initiatives.</li><li>Transfer power and resources to decentralized networks.</li></ul><p>Contributions made to their project will go towards “Regenerative Actions Ticker” on their homepage, DAO templates that local Bloom chapters can use to fund the coordination labor of actions and launch the “Call to Bloom” that will help 100+ local Blooms get started as centers of regenerative action in their cities. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/bloom-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donate to Bloom Network on Giveth.io!</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="must-have-crypto"><strong>Must Have Crypto</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#must-have-crypto" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>is a Cryptocurrency project based out of Kenya led by Mutinda Kisio. The Project is about teaching the masses about Crypto while enabling them to earn a daily basic income. They have minted their own token and plan to use it to teach low income individuals and families about how to use cryptocurrency by providing a steady stream of airdrops up to a maximum of a 1000 addresses. Mutinda is seeking funding to back the value of the token and provide real value to the tokens that are being airdropped. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/musthavecrypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make a Contribution to Must Have Crypto on their Giveth project page.</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="diamante-bridge-collective"><strong>Diamante Bridge Collective</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#diamante-bridge-collective" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>is a group of land stewards in the Diamante Valley, Costa Rica working together to create collective foundational agreements and a local regenerative economy that includes digital currencies for the transparent and accountable recordkeeping of their exchanges. They are building bridges between communities and organizations, local and global cultures, property owners and skilled service providers who are committed to working together long term to care for their bio-region, their neighbors, and the community at large. The Diamante Bridge Collective functions as a hub of many physical nodes, connected via global networks of shared vision and missions with the goal of restoring, preserving and consciously stewarding surrounding lands and watersheds while living harmoniously within them in alignment with planetary values.

Rest assured, we squashed that bug and now the sort/filter/search functionality is working smoothly. We have documented how to obtain a project with a high “quality score” in our <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/guides/qualityscore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth docs</a>. Makers can now ensure that they’re doing everything they can to see their projects rise to the top!</p><p>We’ve upgraded the projects page as well with “infinite scroll”, allowing the user to scroll down the page as new projects load automatically.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Infinite Scroll is fun" class="center" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening2Gif.gif"><p>To further improve upon the quality of projects on our dApp, our team has been working on the new project verification method.

Our favourite projects are going to be highlighted across the Giveth social network, helping them gain cred and support!</p><p>It runs until May 12, 2021, so it’s not too late to submit your projects!</p><hr><p>Coming with our next sprint, we’ll be putting the finishing touches on rich text formatting for project descriptions so Makers can add photos, embed videos, create lists, format texts, and customize the presentation of their project information.</p><p>We’re also continuing to improve email notifications so that our users get appropriate and useful emails in accordance with their interactions on Giveth.</p><p>Further adding to the dApp, we’ll be integrating an embedded support chat so that users on giveth.io can ask questions directly to our team while using the platform.</p><p>Still in the works is the implementation of efficient methods of fiat on-ramping and off-ramping, and we now have more of our team members focusing efforts on resolving this long standing issue.</p><hr><p>As always, we are committed to building the future of giving based on feedback from you, our community!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hello friends and fans of Giveth! This is one part of a series of short transparency posts where we keep you in the loop with updates on what’s in development for</em> <a href="http://giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>giveth.io</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our new DApp <a href="/blog/futureofGiving">went live</a> at <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giveth.io</a> on March 24, 2021, and since then we got some great feedback from our testers and community, and we’ve been hard at work fixing bugs and adding new features.</p><p>First, we addressed the issue of gas fees not being calculated correctly, added an informative banner, and enabled users to login directly on xDai chain. We disabled the ability of a project creator to use a contract address for their project so that donations to all projects can be done either on Mainnet or xDai. We also added more tokens to our list in order to allow the Giver to donate with even more flexibility!</p><p>We onboarded a new member into our dev team and thanks to him we now have functional automated testing that allows us to make changes to the DApp in development and then push to our testing site with greater confidence.</p><p>Next we tackled a bigger fish: the development and implementation of a quality score, sorting/filtering method, and search function to add greater flow and organization to the projects page.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Magic Sorting" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1Meme.gif" width="375" height="auto"><p>Now the projects are sorted by default using a “quality score” — a combination of number of likes, number of donations and quality of project description. We have also added the ability for the user to filter projects by category, and to change the sorting method from the default to “number of likes” or “amount raised”.</p><p>Lastly, you are now able to use the search bar to quickly and easily find the exact project you want to view or Give to!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Filter and Sort on Giveth.io" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1img1.png" width="800" height="auto" class="img_E7b_"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio">“Filter by Category”, “Sort By” and “Search Projects” Features on <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io</a><a class="hash-link" href="#filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>Another exciting update is that we’re now using <a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment</a> analytics and <a href="https://www.autopilothq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autopilot</a> to track activity on the DApp and send appropriate corresponding notifications. We also worked on some internal organization in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/JftjK8Un3z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> that enables us to receive notifications so we can monitor site actions (such as new project creation, new donation, etc.) in-house.</p><p>In the next sprint we’re excited to continue with QA by getting email notifications working smoothly and ensuring that the donation amount (at time of donation) is being calculated and added to the database correctly. We also plan to add rich text formatting to the project creation flow, and enable the Maker to add videos and/or images to their project description. Furthermore, we are now developing systems for project verification to increase the quality of projects on the DApp.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be investigating fiat integration for on-ramping and off-ramping solutions, and continuing to work on creating a white-label option.</p><p>As always, we are committed to building the future of giving based on feedback from you, our community!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img loading="lazy" alt="" src="/img/blog/givethsSIDEbySIDE.png" width="700" height="auto" class="img_E7b_"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="giveth-trace-and-givethio-landing-pages">Giveth TRACE and Giveth.io landing pages<a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-trace-and-givethio-landing-pages" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>A new DApp for Giveth has launched! WOW! Much Excite! The pre-existing Giveth henceforth will be known as Giveth TRACE. The <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Giveth.io Donation Application</a> is an important continuation of our mission to build the future of giving. Both iterations will continue to exist and do contain different features. In this article we’ll be diving into the nitty gritty to help you decide which version of Giveth will aid you the most on your philanthropic venture.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="tldr-"><a href="#summary">TL;DR</a> ←<a class="hash-link" href="#tldr-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Three key distinguishers of the Giveths are: <strong><em>Trust</em></strong>, <strong><em>User Experience,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Scope</em></strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h1><strong><em>Trust</em></strong></h1><p>First up let’s talk about Trust. Giveth TRACE (Originally Giveth Beta) was launched in 2017. Following <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the great DAO hack</a> from the previous year, the burning question at the time was: how do we make these new decentralized innovations resilient and trustworthy? Giveth itself was on the frontlines of these events and set out to solve these issues.</p><p>Giveth TRACE employs smart contracts to handle various transparency-oriented functions of the platform. These interactions happen on the blockchain, including traceable donations, escrow, and dispersal of funds. It uses Milestones for specific projects or goals that can have conditions outlined for funds to be released. An example would be to prove work was done on a project or that money was spent to acquire something specific. The milestone contract is employed to act as an escrow. A milestone creator can designate a recipient other than themselves and also a reviewer. The reviewer of a milestone is responsible to assure that any stated expectations were completed before authorizing the smart contract to release the funds to the recipient.</p><p>The new Giveth DApp does not use smart contracts to facilitate donations but instead provides a true peer-to-peer experience where funds go directly from donor to receiver. The resulting transaction is eternally scribed onto the blockchain. There are no escrow or reviewer functions on the Giveth.io DApp so while donations are much more direct, you are encouraged to do your due diligence before donating.</p><h1><strong><em>User Experience</em></strong></h1><p>Following the rise of ‘cryptokitties’ and the mooning of the price of ETH in 2018, the Rinkeby test network was implemented on Giveth TRACE to resolve absurd gas fees and scalability issues. This allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Dapp for no actual fees, using only gas on Rinkeby to execute the majority of contract transactions. In fact, Giveth actually pays the fees to send your donations to mainnet.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/cryptokitties.png" width="450" height="auto"><p><strong><em>“The Rise and Fall of Ethereum circa 2018 AD”</em></strong></p><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="image-source-mediumcom">Image Source: medium.com<a class="hash-link" href="#image-source-mediumcom" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>Profile creation on Giveth TRACE is facilitated by smart contract interactions on Rinkeby and is reasonably straightforward, however is currently limited to MetaMask. Giveth TRACE currently allows donations in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC and USDC.</p><p>Giveth.io has expanded giving capabilities by allowing donations in ETH and any ERC-20 Token on Mainnet and <a href="https://www.xdaichain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>xDai network</strong></a>! The <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io DApp</a> uses Onboard.js to permit virtually any Ethereum wallet to be used for donations. Project creation has been streamlined, so creators can sign-in, make a project and start collecting funds literally in minutes. For creating a profile you may choose between standard MetaMask login or Torus Wallet. Torus Wallet also provides a crypto on-ramping feature so you can convert your cold-hard cash into cryptocurrency very easily and get to donating in the digital age. <a href="https://docs.tor.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More Info on Torus wallet can be found here.</a></p><h1><strong><em>Scope</em></strong></h1><p>Scope  is the last, but perhaps coolest, distinction I want to mention. Giveth TRACE has <strong>huge</strong> scope: its donation hierarchy is broken down into Communities (formerly known as DACs), Campaigns, and Milestones. Donations made to Communities and Campaigns are stored in a ‘pledge’ vault. The Community or Campaign manager can then delegate your pledge into the Campaign or Milestone, respectively, of their choosing. This system created by Giveth has coined the term ‘Liquid Pledging’ and in effect allows for curated donor funds. This means would-be donors can make non-custodial contributions to causes that they care about and funds can find their way to the right place at the right time. Once your funds have been delegated you’re able to track where they went on Giveth TRACE.</p><p>Giveth.io Dapp aims to provide a simpler experience. While not achieving the same scope of Giveth TRACE it is much easier to navigate. Donations made on Giveth.io go straight A → B and the project owners themselves dictate the scope by the projects they choose to create.</p><h1><span id="summary"><strong><em>To Summarize:</em></strong></span></h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="giveth-trace"><em>Giveth TRACE</em><a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-trace" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Allows for donations on macro and micro levels via Communities, Campaigns, and Milestones</li><li>Has a system of oversight to prevent misuse or fraud</li><li>Donations accepted in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC, and USDC</li><li>Curated Donor Funds via ‘Liquid Pledging’</li><li>Giveth doesn’t charge any fees, in fact we pay the fees to send funds to the recipient</li><li>Works with MetaMask</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="givethio">Giveth.io<a class="hash-link" href="#givethio" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Streamlined project creation accessible for all</li><li>Multi-wallet functionality</li><li>Peer-to-peer transactions</li><li>Giveth doesn’t charge any fees</li><li>Fiat donations via Torus On-ramping</li><li>ETH and ERC-20 token donations</li><li>Donate on <strong>xDai</strong> and save on gas</li></ul><p>The new Giveth is straightforward if you’re looking to make simple donations peer to peer without any added complexity but with more connectivity.

Our flagship DApp (live for 3 years at beta.giveth.io) is now being rebranded as “Giveth TRACE”. Giveth TRACE offers a platform for peer-to-peer donations on the blockchain with detailed traceability for “Givers” and mutual aid projects. However, it does require some knowledge of Ethereum and wallet management.</p><p><strong><em>With the new Giveth, project owners anywhere in the world can publish an online profile and start accepting donations within minutes.</em></strong></p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="/img/blog/futureofGivingmeme1.jpeg" width="500" height="auto" class="img_E7b_"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="image-credit-grandma-finds-the-internet-via-imgflip">Image Credit: Grandma Finds the Internet via <a href="https://imgflip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imgflip</a><a class="hash-link" href="#image-credit-grandma-finds-the-internet-via-imgflip" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><img loading="lazy" alt="" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/futureofGivingSignIn.png" width="375" height="auto"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="screenshot-taken-from-giveth">Screenshot taken from <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth</a><a class="hash-link" href="#screenshot-taken-from-giveth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>Both Torus and MetaMask wallets are fully integrated into the DApp, meaning that a blockchain newbie can create a wallet with Torus by signing in via social media as easily as the crypto-savvy can sign in with their MetaMask browser extension. Torus integration also means that Giveth is compatible with mobile and a wide range of desktop browsers.</p><p>Once logged in, a “Maker” can follow the highly intuitive step-by-step project creation flow and begin raising funds in crypto right away with zero fees added by Giveth.</p><p><strong><em>100% of every donation goes directly to the project.

From enabling Givers to donate to the causes they believe in and providing a layer of <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency and accountability</a> through our <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp</a>, we will now be tackling the sustainability of the donation process itself. <strong>We want to create continuous streams of funding through the creation of economies around causes</strong>, by building a system of <a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token bonding curves</a> feeding cause-focused DAOs (with a unique governance model) on top of the Giveth DApp, in a collaboration with <a href="https://block.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlockScience</a>.</p><p><em>Edit May 2019: for more on the Commons Stack initiative, read</em> <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-e1293123831d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>this most recent update</em></a> <em>by</em> <a href="https://medium.com/u/ae6d20c4931e?source=post_page-----ac265e3010b8--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jeff Emmett</em></a><em>, for a technical deepdive by</em> <a href="https://medium.com/u/5967a5d3b611?source=post_page-----ac265e3010b8--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Abbey Titcomb</em></a> <em>go</em> <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="from-centralized-donations-to-sustainable-collaborations"><strong><em>From centralized Donations to sustainable Collaborations</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#from-centralized-donations-to-sustainable-collaborations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If you have been following Giveth closely, you will know by now that we are not your regular organization and are constantly changing our own collaboration models through many experiments, and that we are involved in <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-partners-with-alibre-io-for-last-mile-solution-in-mexico-50c5155dfcd5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-unicorndac-a-non-hierarchical-decentralized-governance-experiment-8dfbe6e98d19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> <a href="https://medium.com/aragon-dac/aragon-dac-a-new-community-effort-to-foster-aragons-development-led-by-giveth-2228dcc17b63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initiatives</a>, seemingly not moving in just one specific direction, but actually, we are! <strong>We are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (DAC) focused on making the World a Better Place</strong> through the use of blockchain technology, and yes, this is a wide and ambitious <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mission</a>. But we have a path we are on, well, actually we have several, and we are doing this on purpose, to make us more resilient, even antifragile. The Ethereum community and the blockchain space as a whole is in constant flux, so we are working on and supporting a wide array of different initiatives (we call it the <a href="https://giveth.io/#galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth Galaxy</a>) that we believe are bringing lasting value to the wider community.</p><p>During this cryptowinter, we ourselves, as a non-profit blockchain-based entity, have been struggling quite a bit to keep financially afloat and have only been able to do this through a generous donation by <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/surprise-285-eth-anonymous-donation-given-to-giveth-9167266a5085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an anonymous donor</a>, but mostly through a constant stream of <a href="https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5b37da13a239ac21b383d4da" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal donations by our co-founder Griff Green</a>, for which we are eternally grateful. This scarcity however got us to discuss our own sustainability quite a bit, and the importance of good, objective governance that will benefit our individual and collective interests, our ‘Commons’. <strong>Depending on pure goodwill, even if it happens in a transparent and accountable way, is not sustainable</strong>, not for us nor for any other altruistic community: it puts you in a scarcity mindset and is a heavy distraction from the cause(s) that unite you. This concern made us see more clearly than ever that we have to invest time in bringing Giving to the next level, and change the way humans collaborate.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="123--infinity"><strong><em>1–2–3 — Infinity.</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#123--infinity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>First things first, we are very happy and proud to say that <strong>our flagship project, the Giveth DApp,</strong> <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>currently in beta</strong></a><strong>, is now</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/whats-dappening-0x5-ultra-configurable-milestones-27ff92383de2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature-complete</a><strong>,</strong> bringing us very close to what we could call ‘Giveth 1.0’. This of course does not mean that we will stop working on the DApp, on the contrary, much more is coming, such as deploying our DApp on the <a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-partners-with-makerdao-on-xdai-chain-the-first-ever-usd-stable-blockchain-65a078c41e6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xDAI chain</a>, introducing governance solutions through <a href="http://aragon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a>, a complete UX overhaul and so much more. This is all in the making but in order to continue with this, we are currently focusing very hard on the funding part of the puzzle<strong>.</strong> We want to help forward the ecosystem itself through an ambitious token-engineering experiment, in collaboration with <a href="https://block.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlockScience</a>. <strong>The target of this experiment is to transform communities around altruistic causes into entire economies and to build this on top of the Giveth DApp.</strong> In the coming months, we will be working hard on this initiative that will bring us at some point to what we like to call ‘Giveth 2.0’.</p><p>Now that we have traceable donations working in the DApp, we can start to experiment with new models to support both the organization as well as the funding of communities. Your support stays very, very welcome (<a href="http://giveth.io/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all tokens accepted</a> 🙏) but in the long run, we want to incentivize you so that you are no longer just a Giver, but have a real stake in the success of the community you will be supporting: <strong>we want to align the very human behavior of profit-seeking with socially beneficial behavior: to us this is the real Future of Giving</strong>.</p><p>We built the foundational layer of our Giveth DApp on the Ethereum blockchain and not on a centralized server to bring <strong>true accountability and transparency to decentralized governance experiments</strong>: there is an immutable piece of evidence of what happened with your funds. The true magic however, that will allow us to create sustainable streams of funding, lies hidden within the existing dynamics of blockchain technology. <strong>Every blockchain network in existence has aligned incentives around supporting the network itself: every ‘actor’ in the system, when acting in their own best interest, actually benefits the system.</strong> Miners earn inflation for supporting the network, developers hold the token hoping their efforts will raise its value, and users buy the token creating demand and pay transaction fees: it is a very simple and well-balanced ecosystem: <strong>helping yourself, helps the system to thrive, and very often it doesn’t even matter whether that system is useful or not.</strong></p><p>We are building the Future Of Giving and are fascinated by these mechanisms, we want to use these self-sustaining models for actual good. <strong>The ‘Commons’</strong> can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined</a> as “<!-- -->[<!-- -->…<!-- -->]<!-- --> resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage <strong>for individual and collective benefit</strong>.” We, and many communities like ours, that are organized around social impact causes, are suffering from scarcity, because <strong>we think about the collective benefit and ignore the individual,</strong> who needs to survive as well; this is unsustainable. By default, people will actually do the opposite and take their individual interest over that of the common good, which is often called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tragedy of the commons</a>. In <strong>both cases</strong>, there is a major incentive alignment issue: either the individual gains but the collective suffers or the other way around. Witnessing for a while now these emerging, more sustainable systems, we believe it is time for the next step. By modeling the success of existing blockchain ecosystems (through the implementation of new cryptoeconomic primitives) we want <strong>to create abundance to support the Commons</strong>, thinking about both the collective as well as the individual interests.</p><p>Now, our goal at Giveth is to use token engineering, more specifically, Curation Markets, to bring this from a purely digital realm, into the real world. We will build it on top of our Dapp, and <strong>build it in such a way that it supports projects that benefit our common interest</strong>, or in other words, that will enable us to sustainably crowdfund the Commons. The initial work was to enable transparent and accountable donations on the blockchain, the next step is to move away from ‘donating’ altogether and to create a sustainable system: <strong>gifted funds become backed by a token of value in a circular economy.</strong> As <a href="https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbey Titcomb</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>“We believe the answer to the underfunding of social goods and underserved community contribution is to reframe social goods as self-governing and continuously funded commons.”</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="wait-but-how"><strong>Wait but How?</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#wait-but-how" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Through building the augmented bonding curve model created by <a href="https://block.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlockScience</a> on top of our DApp we want to create continuously funded organizations. How does this work? We first learned about them through <a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffemmett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Emmett</a>, a Giveth collaborator, who explains the basic building blocks — a highly recommended read to learn more on how token bonding curves could enable a project to bootstrap funding and token value along with project success and popularity. You can find more references in Abbey Titcomb’s report on <a href="https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what we built at ETHDenver</a>, and for all <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelzargham/jargon-party-e3616cd16a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical definitions</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/block-science/on-the-practice-of-token-engineering-part-i-c2cc2434e727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more theory</a>, we refer you to <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelzargham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Zargham</a>.</p><p>However, we would like to illustrate the theory now through a real life example of how this could work, imagining a future in which Giveth has already built this model into its DApp (also available <a href="https://youtu.be/WJ23oQpooG0?t=694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in video format, narrated by Griff Green</a>):</p><p>So imagine you live by the beach, and you have the habit of picking up trash regularly, but you see this is just not having the impact you desire: it doesn’t scale. For more impact you are also regularly donating to a nonprofit promising exactly this, large-scale impact but … all you see is a lot of marketing and a continuous request for more funds. This is all very frustrating.</p><p>At this point in time, you run into Jonathan, an activist who you often saw on the beach doing exactly what you do: cleaning up. He tells you about a new kid on the block: the ‘TrashHeroes’ and they are offering you something else. They invite you to not just give money but to actually help them steer the organization. In return for an amount you choose you will receive tokens, tokens that allow you to make decisions for the common good of the organization. On top of this, if you do a good job and the organization runs smoothly one day those tokens could be worth more than what you donated. This sounds too good to be true, but hey, you were donating funds anyways and with this one you get a say in the decisions!</p><p>So you give 10 xDAI (<a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-partners-with-makerdao-on-xdai-chain-the-first-ever-usd-stable-blockchain-65a078c41e6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a representation of DAI token</a>) and receive TrashHero Tokens, which you hear actually have value, in the real world. <strong>The value however, is not determined by an open market, but by a smart contract</strong>, which is actually the token bonding curve. So how does this work you ask? The price, the value of the TrashHero Token, is determined by the total supply of the token in general: if more people mint the token in return for xDAI, the price of the TrashHero Token goes up. If the supply goes down — when people burn their tokens and take money out of the contract the price of the token goes down. <strong>The big difference however with existing curve models, and which makes this one sustainable is two-fold.</strong> First, there is <strong>the curve itself</strong> which disincentivizes people who get in late to burn their tokens quickly, they need to keep these for a while if they want to make a profit. The second element is that people who get in early should be the people who are in it for the long haul, because they are the believers in the cause, they will most often be the experts. This is stimulated by preventing our pioneers from burning their tokens immediately: <strong>their tokens are locked until specific goals</strong> (which we call Milestones in our DApp) have been reached. In this way the collective interests you are fighting for are protected by default, the Commons needs those funds and outweigh your short-term self-interest, and you are incentivized to reach the set goals, the Milestones. <strong>This innovative system where everyone acts in their own self-interest, propels the Commons forward and pushes it to reach its set goals.</strong></p><p>Back to our TrashHeroes that have invited you to be part of this initial group of experts who together have raised quite some xDAI to initialize the curve and the TrashHero Commons. One half, 50% of this xDAI, is locked in the smart contract, 50% of this xDAI is given to a DAO controlled by the TrashHero token holders to execute on their common interest, now baptized the TrashHero Commons. <strong>This Commons that supports the cause of cleaning up the beaches will now need to come up with good proposals to actually support this cause. As the Commons spends money, the tokens that were given to the group that initialized the curve will become unlocked periodically.</strong> This spending goes through Milestones you help create in the Giveth DApp: xDAI will be released once the initiative takers (the ‘Milestone Managers’) prove they have actually reached the goals they set that support the Commons’ cause (i.e. cleaning up beaches) — this is where the power of Giveth kicks in: <strong>you only get rewarded when you are being accountable</strong>.</p><p>The effective working of the TrashHero Commons is steered through a novel type of curation market governance system that allows you to use your TrashHero Tokens to signal priorities of tasks (Milestones) to be executed for the Commons to reach its goals. When a target that supports the goals of the Commons is proposed — for example, you get 15 friends together and make a Milestone for doing a side-by-side, step-by-step cleaning of 5 km of coast — and if it is supported by the TrashHero Token holders, it will receive funding from the Commons: xDAI will be sent to the Giveth Milestone. Then once the task has been completed, by documenting in pictures and videos the gathering of 3 tons of plastic and waste, the xDAI will be sent to the token bonding curve and you will be minted TrashHero Tokens, which you can then decide to burn immediately (without a need to speculate if you don’t want to) to receive your xDAI. When you or anyone else decides to burn your tokens, there is a fee that goes back into the Commons, which is the lever that will support more social good. <strong>To us, this is the Future of Giving</strong>: your socially beneficial behavior creates a surplus!</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJ23oQpooG0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="griff-greens-talk-at-ethcc-paris-on-the-evolutionary-movement-of-human-collaboration-through-blockchain-trashhero-commons-example-starts-at-1055"><em>Griff Green’s talk at EthCC Paris on the evolutionary movement of human collaboration through blockchain (TrashHero Commons example starts at</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/WJ23oQpooG0?t=655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>10:55</em></a><em>)</em><a class="hash-link" href="#griff-greens-talk-at-ethcc-paris-on-the-evolutionary-movement-of-human-collaboration-through-blockchain-trashhero-commons-example-starts-at-1055" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="generosity-generates-income"><strong>Generosity generates Income</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#generosity-generates-income" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Doing good <em>feels</em> good, and we hope our alternative economic system will attract more people who want to do good by not just giving but by staying involved. <strong>Instead of just simply donating, they get the opportunity to participate in a circular economy that supports the underlying cause</strong>. As more people will be encouraged to join the Commons, it incentivizes the people who initialized the curve to do even better, as the initial token holder’s funds will only be unlocked as the community actually does good, and spends the money. <strong>By being generous and by participating in good governance they can generate an actual financial return, an income — they create abundance.</strong></p><p>Next to this, speculators will get involved, because that is what happens with tokens, and actually, its great! Secondary markets and the trading volume will hopefully create an extra flow of funds that isn’t normally part of a charitable community. <strong>After the initialization of the curve, the new donations create tokens that have no locking period, and 100% of those funds go straight into the bonding curve.</strong> When later participants burn their tokens they however always pay a fee, and this fee goes back into the Commons, which further support its goals. Every participant — whether it is an initial crowdfunder, a regular Giver or a speculator — should and will act in their own self-interest, which is steering the Commons to become a success, with everyone’s incentives aligned.</p><p><strong>One more important note: this is a giant experiment and it may not work.</strong> However because of the use of the Giveth DApp the projects that are looking to clean up beaches, help the homeless or do research to cure Alzheimer are insulated from the governance experiment’s failure. <strong>The benefit is that these initiatives will exist on our Giveth DApp, so there are multiple ways to fund them.</strong> If a token holder really wants a specific Giveth Milestone to be supported but the governance of the Commons breaks down for one reason or another, they can burn their token (again helping the economy through a small fee), receive xDAI, and send it directly to the specific Milestone on the DApp they wanted to support. The Commons is one actor in an open system. What we will have done is create an extra way to fund projects on our DApp and most probably generate quite some buzz around that specific economy, a buzz supported both by the community as well as by speculators. Whatever happens, more people will know that this cause needs to be supported.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="we-started-building-this-future-of-giving-yesterday"><strong>We started Building this Future of Giving Yesterday</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#we-started-building-this-future-of-giving-yesterday" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With every statement we make, new questions come up (for example <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/!vwFGsktMNkdorFWJRi:matrix.org/$1552247327760014NjKKA:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&amp;via=giveth.io&amp;via=status.im" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this dialogue in our chat</a>), and we do not have all the answers just yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Why are bosses necessary? They aren’t. Self-managed organizations exist all over the world, but there is no template for how a decentralized self-managed organization should work. Let us try to change that.</em></p><p>Self-managed organizations (those without a management middlemen layer and hierarchy) have to overcome a lot of hurdles when it comes to governance. For example, on one side, the direction of the organization cannot be dictated top-down by management and on the other side nobody can push responsibility up and “just do what they are told”.</p><p>These hurdles, Frederic Laloux, author of “<a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinventing Organizations</a>” suggests, exist mainly because traditional management practices and traditionally managed organizations are so prevalent that we have a lack of examples to follow. In other words, we might have never seen better! Moreover, there have been years and years of organizational research and practice on hierarchical structures (think both about an old-age tribe with a clear, visible head and also a large corporation with a twitter rant-prone CEO).</p><p>On top of that, we have new models of governance arising within blockchain structures or enabled by blockchain solutions (<a href="https://medium.com/@leo_pold_b/blockchain-governance-takeaways-from-nine-projects-8a80ad214d15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s</a> a pretty good article that touches on some of the key points), although there is not so much literature on specifically non-hierarchical, egalitarian structures.</p><p>While there are great companies pushing the envelope in both blockchain governance and self-management, it’s time for us to investigate, explore and document different forms of non-hierarchical governance for organizations. Giveth’s Governance Circle, and particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/Loie_Low" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loie</a>, whose goal is to foster governance experiments, is launching the Unicorn DAC on that regard. Lorelei devoted countless hours to ideate, iterate and bring to life this project with the rest of the Unicorns… and this is the result.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="stepping-up-the-game">Stepping up the game<a class="hash-link" href="#stepping-up-the-game" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Operationally, Giveth works much like a swarm. Around a strong core of main contributors, collaborators that are aligned with the purpose of Giveth come and go and offer their time, ideas and work. Some of these collaborators do one assignment and leave and others stay collaborating on the periphery but for the longest time. They are rewarded through a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RewardDAO</a>, with which everyone can get points that then can be exchanged for ether if they upload a video on our <a href="https://fame.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall of Fame</a> or to the <a href="https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3d9746329bc64ae74d1424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp itself</a>.</p><p>But these points are awarded somewhat arbitrarily and there’s a limited amount of monthly ether that goes to fund these rewards. Hence, the amount that collaborators receive in ether can vary depending on other people’s contributions and points. We think it’s a great introductory system for getting into the Giveth Galaxy, but might not be ideal as a fully decentralized non-hierarchical governance model. In fact, it’s not really a complete governance model, as it doesn’t necessarily steer Giveth’s big decisions, but our experience tells us that it does motivate people to take initiative, talk to the most committed contributors and suggest new projects and initiatives.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="put-your-money-where-your-purpose-is"><strong>Put your money where your purpose is</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#put-your-money-where-your-purpose-is" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To be clear, governance in self-managed organizations boils down to who decides — and how it is decided — what the organization dedicates its resources to?</p><p>So in the case of Giveth, the question was: How could we empower everyone that is fully committed to Giveth to decide what actions and what strategic direction should the organization take? And even further, could we do that in a way that we leverage our own products, i.e. the Giveth DApp? -we do like our #dogfooding!</p><p>Well, the Giveth DApp allows Makers to create <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACs, Campaigns and Milestones</a>, and Givers to fund whatever change they want to see realized in the world. Could we not create a DAC that Unicorns can use to propose projects through Milestones, and other Unicorns can fund them if they think they are aligned with Giveth’s purpose? We would distribute money to our Unicorns — this group of core contributors — and they could fund any Milestone they wanted.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What better way to steer an organization than by democratizing both the access to resources and the power to propose actions and then let everyone actually put resources where the Giveth purpose lies the strongest?</strong></p></blockquote><p>Sometimes Unicorns will decide to fund already existing Milestones, and sometimes they will create a new bounty. This gives everyone the power to suggest a project, give it a price tag, and if the funding target gets reached, empower and pay this person to make it happen. If it doesn’t get funded, it would mean that the project was possibly not so aligned with the general feeling and purpose anyway.</p><p><strong>Examples of funded proposals:</strong></p><p>a) Lorelei is often frustrated by the lack of sharing info in the Ethereum community. Everybody seems to be having the same conversations but no one is hearing each other. When she hears about Tennagraph, the community signaling aggregator to answer just this need, she becomes very passionate about it and decides to use her Unicorn DAC delegation allowance to fund Deam to go to Web3 Summit and raise awareness and adoption for Tennagraph!</p><p>b) Lanski has identified a feature for our <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp</a> that a bunch of Makers would like to have in the platform. It might not seem it’s a priority from a technical point of view, but as a matter of fact, all the feedback that he is receiving from the users mentions that particular need. He assesses the cost with the DApp team and creates a Milestone where they (the DApp team) are the beneficiary. The work, though, is too expensive and he cannot pay it on his own, but Lorelei realizes how important the feature is and funds the Milestone too so the DApp team can go ahead and build it to claim the Milestone.</p><p><strong>Example of an unsuccessful proposal:</strong></p><p>Lanski wants to make stickers of Giveth’s logo to stick all over the world — for marketing purposes. Everyone has got some stickers left from the last batch, but not enough to cover half of the world with them, so he wants to make MORE. But the general consensus is that we are publicizing well and doing the right outreach in the circles that we want to attract at this stage, so nobody actually funds the Milestone. Sorry Lanski, maybe later when we decide to do a publicity campaign for the general public!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="ins-and-outs-of-the-unicorn-dac"><strong>Ins and outs of the Unicorn DAC</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#ins-and-outs-of-the-unicorn-dac" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This Governance experiment is precisely that, an experiment. And the initial parameters are sort of arbitrarily defined and will be polished as we go along.</p><ol><li>We’ve been a community gathered around shared principles and purpose for a while now, but never had an official onboarding process because there’s no clear entity to be onboarded to. Now, we have the opportunity to come together around these agreements and create a membrane that gathers and recognizes the most committed of us as we join the Unicorn DAC. You can read about our Onboarding Process <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/unicorn-dac/unicorn-onboarding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, which ensures commitment to Giveth’s purpose and alignment with our principles in order to opt to be part of the DAC.</li><li>The resource allowance per head will be the equivalent in ether to 600 USD every week. In order for people not to fund only their own Milestones, we have capped the amount people can put into their own Milestones at 150 USD, so 450 will be used to decide on other people’s initiatives. Unicorns don’t have to use the full 600 USD every week if they feel that there are no interesting projects to fund, or the ones that are truly interesting are already fully funded.</li><li>Needless to say, people can choose NOT to fund any of their own Milestones. The reason why we allow people to self-fund their Milestones for a certain amount is to facilitate the funding of menial or uninteresting jobs that have to be done, but they would waste people’s time and resources if they had to be reviewed and funded by other unicorns.</li><li>We cannot expect people to feel connected to a purpose by only chipping money into Milestones. Hence, in order to keep purpose alive, we have a once a month Unicorn Meeting! Here, we discuss which projects we delegated to and why it is aligned to Giveth.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, Milestones will be created by those who hold roles related to the matter at hand. That’s not to say that people can’t have great ideas outside of their roles, but they should follow the <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/advice-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advice process</a> and certainly consult with those who hold relevant roles before taking action, even if it is merely for keeping information flows going. Roles are evaluated on how well they have been fulfilled in a peer review system every month.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="mvping-our-way-through-it"><strong>MVPing our way through it</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#mvping-our-way-through-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We are ready to try the Unicorn DAC and carve our own way in decentralized governance practices. As the experiment that it is, we do expect some issues to come up, and we have already identified a few:</p><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dogfooding</a> is our motto because we believe the Giveth DApp is a great tool. Nevertheless, it does not yet have the advanced functionalities of a compounded delegation system that would allow you to allocate only up to a percentage of funds into your own Milestones and the rest to others. We will track donations manually at this point while we look for a solution, be it homemade or leveraging <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a>.</li><li>Foreign influence. Our DAC will always be public, transparent and held to the highest standards, but the fact that it’s an open way to fund the projects that Giveth undertakes, it could be exposed to an admittedly unlikely vector of attack where a powerful party decides to fund specific Milestones or projects that are on the periphery of the purpose and this acts in detriment of the best direction to take. This would be a similar attack to sovereignty to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893815001003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMF dictating policies to countries</a> in exchange for bailouts or access to concessional loans.</li><li>That said, we have funds to support this initiative for a limited period of time, and since Giveth is a non-profit blockchain entity that accepts donations, if you are a donor and <strong>want to support Blockchain4Good projects PLUS a decentralized non-hierarchical governance experiment like the Unicorn DAC</strong>, we are all ears (and eyes!): hit us up on <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riot</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> or fund us <a href="https://giveth.io/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly</a>!</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="already-winning"><strong>Already winning</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#already-winning" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Unicorn DAC was presented during DevCon4 at the <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/devcon4-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon Dream DAO contest</a>… and it won the runner-up prize! 250 ANT + 250 DAI for making it a reality!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img loading="lazy" alt="Connections" src="/img/blog/futureOfWork.png" class="img_E7b_"><p>The world is changing at a rapid pace. Gone are the days where you could work 30 years at a company, then get a fancy watch and a golden handshake into retirement. The industrial revolution of the early 1800’s brought more people out of the country and into factories and workshops, attracted by better pay.</p><p>And while offices were growing in number back then, it wasn’t until the 20th century that office culture became a mainstream phenomenon. Now with the arrival of the internet and, more recently, blockchain we are seeing another shift in the way people work.</p><p>At <a href="https://medium.com/bounties-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Bounties Network</strong></a> and <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Giveth Social Coding</strong></a> we decided to collaborate on this topic. So we recently posed and posted a question about The Future of Work:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If you love your employees let them go, to Thailand, to school, to a sabbatical where ever they might choose. The constraints placed on us today in the working economy are unreasonable and completely unconducive to personal growth, truth, happiness and workplace fulfilment.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Today we’re going to integrate some of the responses from <a href="https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/1641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>that post</strong></a> to get a better idea of how the future of work may look like.</p><h1>Location, Location, Location</h1><p>The company of the future is no longer bound by company walls or even country borders for that matter. Employers are starting to understand that sourcing the best talent at the right price is more important than where they are located. Poster <strong>Jose Aguinaga</strong> highlights this about his international company:</p><blockquote><p><em>In our company, we are roughly 15+ employees/designers all over the world. We have people from Mexico City to New Zealand, in Vancouver and Sofia. We started in Switzerland, and have embraced a decentralized workspace from day 1.</em></p></blockquote><p>Many jobs these days only require a laptop and a good internet connection</p><p>The internet ushered in the digital economy and a huge percentage of job postings these days are looking for digital skills. The obvious benefit of this is that you can work remotely just about anywhere you have a computer and a decent internet connection.</p><p>Jose goes on to explain, however, that remote working is not for everybody. It requires discipline, flexibility, and a sense of responsibility that may not suit everyone’s personality. Some workers are just not cut out for that kind of independence. To be clear, many jobs still require us to be in the same space. But in the future, we will be able to solve many of the problems that come with trying to cram so many people into big cities.</p><h1>Working in Tune with Your Own Rhythms</h1><p>Let’s expand on that a bit. As many of you will know, working a 9–5 job in a major city can be a real headache. With worldwide populations continuing to grow, it’s not unheard of to hear people spend 2–3 hours every day commuting to work. But now many companies are starting to wake up to the fact that many tasks are not time-specific. Do you really need to be in the office at 9 to respond to client emails for an hour?</p><p>In addition, employees are not robots (most anyway) and do not function with on/off switches. Every worker is unique and possesses strengths and weaknesses. People produce their best work at various times of the day. User <strong>Brad</strong> highlighted this in his post with the following words:</p><blockquote><p><em>It has been repeatedly shown that creative and intelligent minds are more likely to be night owls, and unlikely to stay tied down to one place for long periods of time.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now whether or not that fits your profile is irrelevant. Some people love the early morning hours and take the afternoon off. Some work perfectly in the 9–5 structure. Others, as Brad suggests, work well into the night when the peace and quiet provide plenty of opportunities to get work done.</p><p>To add to that, most workers would agree that one of the most important aspects of a job is a healthy working environment. Happy employees are productive workers. Poster <strong>Bount<!-- -->_<!-- -->Hunter</strong> highlights this well in his/her post:</p><blockquote><p><em>If the person you want to do X job for you is happier to be doing it a 8pm -4 am in Malaysia vs 9–5 in chicago their work will always be better. We’ve all worked jobs we HATE (i’m currently doing that now) and you don’t get the best work from people who are working jobs they don’t like.</em></p></blockquote><h1>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</h1><p>It should come as no surprise then that decentralized organizations are springing up everywhere. And blockchain is pioneering this effort with projects dedicated to making that kind of a future a reality. Take <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Aragon</strong></a> for example, a project aimed at breaking down traditional borders and intermediaries.</p><p>In the modern world, much of the existing business value is captured by those at the top of the pyramid. It’s a little sad then that many of the people creating that value don’t actually get rewarded for doing so. The workplace of tomorrow will flatten these management structures and allow the value to be distributed more evenly.</p><p>Take this very article for example. It was crowd-sourced and funded from contributors around the world using a decentralized application. What could be more empowering than allowing employees to have an active stake and say in the company and process from the get-go?</p><h1>Closing Thoughts: The Future of Work</h1><p>It’s sometimes hard to see a change in the future of work since we’ve been following a centralized hierarchical office model for many years now. The only thing we can be certain of is change. Those that embrace it are usually the ones who reap the most rewards in the new economy.</p><p>Finally, to highlight the real-life change we are facing as work evolves, let me tell you a little about my own history. I am a South African who is dating a German who lives in the Netherlands. My mother is Italian and I work part-time for an American company. Borders are completely artificial constructions of man. The human spirit doesn’t want to be tied down by the rules of a few men sitting in an office somewhere. The future of work is exciting. The future of work is decentralized.</p><p>Are you ready to join us in the distributed work space?

Most of us are very, very tech-minded and geeky people, and we love tech, but that is not what it is about or why we are here. It is about the people, the human connection.</p><p>We live in a world that has never been more connected, but never have we felt more isolated, never have our individualistic traits and our ego been more nurtured (think social media, for one) than today. But has it made us happier? Definitely not. Even worse, it has made us retreat into ourselves, giving less, both emotionally as well as financially. Giveth wants to turn the tide, bring back the connection by building/buidling and making the World a Better Place.</p><p>We are not an organization, not a DAO, we strive to be more, we are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (a DAC). Communities are based on shared values and this is what corporations and organizations lack. They do pretend to have core values, but these are outward facing, top-down and are used for branding purposes. Our values are bottom-up, crowdsourced and are the higher good that connects us.</p><p>We are a community of individuals and we celebrate and respect each and everyone’s uniqueness.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="we-dare-to-be-vulnerable">We dare to be Vulnerable<a class="hash-link" href="#we-dare-to-be-vulnerable" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Our main value, our essence lies in vulnerability. Most of the people at Giveth, and even in the wider ‘Maker’ blockchain space (=the opposite of daytrader land) are here because they know what ego and image brings to the world. They are professionals who have lived the corporate life and knew something was ‘off’. Hierarchy and image boosting bring pain, misunderstanding and most of all a huge waste of time and loads of inefficiency.</p><p>When you dare to be vulnerable - even fragile, open and true - you can make lasting changes, because it’s the only way to truly connect with another human being. And together, when you connect, you always achieve more.</p><p>Another crucial reason to open up is because ‘the system’ has trained us to be numb by providing us with all possible tools (binge-watching, medication, social media, shopping, … the list is endless). We have been trained to care less, to be less conscious of suffering and injustice, during a time where we are actually hyper-connected and thus can be hyper-informed. Knowledge brings power: sharing your thoughts, ideas and feelings can change the world. We just have to express our <strong>outrage</strong> and team up, because right now, as individuals, together, we actually have a bigger impact than ever before in the history of mankind.</p></blockquote><p>(Please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THIS</a> if you never have before)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="we-are-inclusive">We are Inclusive<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-inclusive" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Everyone is welcome, we are huggers. We believe everyone has talents, has skills and can contribute to Making the World a Better Place. If you see a need in our community you should come over and get it done (see ‘We are Makers’). But even if you just want to lurk around, you should, even just you being there inspires us and we hope to inspire you.</p><p>We believe in equal rights, even more, this is a given, this is no topic of discussion. No matter what gender, race, religion or political philosophy you adhere to: you are welcome, and you will be loved.

Abundance is the opposite of fear and scarcity, the things that make people become protective and close-minded. We want to give people the chance to develop themselves. We want to be a spark of light, a pulsing star in this galaxy, an inspiration to others, an energy that rubs off.</p><p>Only if we harness this internal energy we will be able to make real and lasting change in this world. When there is abundance people thrive and are able to not only show off their skills but their talents. The difference between skills and talents is that you no longer only do what you are good at, you do what brings happiness into your life and you bring this into the lives of others.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="we-are-striving-to-be-fully-decentralized">We are striving to be fully Decentralized<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-striving-to-be-fully-decentralized" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Money is not evil.

This decentralized altruistic community is known as Giveth.</p><p>Like the Unicorns who make up Giveth, Giveth is diverse and ever-growing.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Giveth is both a culture and a manifestation of intent.</li><li>Giveth is an expression of love and the result of action and hard work.</li><li>Giveth is a transparent proof of decentralized governance in action.</li><li>Giveth is an amalgamation of altruism and the adjacent possible.</li><li>Giveth is a global community and a gift to the world.</li><li>Giveth is open, welcoming, and ready to support you in making the world a better place.</li></ul><blockquote><p>If you have money available to donate to people in need, you can watch its transmittance across the world on an open ledger to assure it actually gets to those who need it. With the tools and technologies available to us, there’s no more bureaucracy to siphon off funds along the way to the recipients. Giveth doesn’t even take a cut — it doesn’t need to — it’s funded through the same process as the project you just donated to.</p><p>If you have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, you’ll find the Giveth platform maximizes the efficiency and impact of the work you do with clearly defined milestones and the minimal number of actors needed to accomplish the goal. Transparency and accountability are built in, so your work is both noticed and supported by your fellow Unicorns as well as the donors themselves.</p><p>If you have willpower and like-minded individuals and you decide to initiate your own causes, you’ll discover an easy-to-use toolset that enables you to create a project with the same ease as creating a blog post. You’ll immediately be able to start receiving donations and create clear steps to achieving your ultimate outcome with no red-tape or fees of any kind.</p><p>The best part about Giveth is that anybody can join the community and contribute to making the world a better place. If you’re a human being living on planet Earth and you want to do good, we are your people, and this is your opportunity to make a real impact. Make your mark and add your name to the growing community of Unicorns from around the world by joining us on this magnificent journey to building the future of giving!</p><p><strong>With A Love That Echoes Throughout The Galaxy</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/b60aa9f7ce4d?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Joshua Du Chene</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮</p><h1>The life of the Giveth Unicorn</h1><blockquote><p>Giveth Unicorns may come and go.

At its core Giveth enables communities to form around the causes that matter to them the most. On a personal level Giveth is the reason I shifted my vision from only seeing fungible stores of value loosely referred to as ‘crypto’ and decided to dedicate my corporeal energy to enabling trust within this space. A bit about me is in order first however.</p><p>I came to ‘crypto’ not as a newbie but someone who was well versed in utilizing cryptographic hashes and technology within daily operations. My first introduction to personal computers came in 1986 when my family moved to Houston TX, and I would play games like ‘Wheel of Fortune’ , ‘Ninja Gaiden’, and ‘SpiderMan’ on our IBM 8086. My first tech job came at the age of 17 where I taught children QBASIC, html, and audio processing at the ‘American Computer Experience’ summer camps. Fast forward to 2009 and my technolust was immediately sparked by this thing I caught wind of called Bitcoin. I had no position in the market other than watching the price of BTC go from near nothing to over $10 USD/BTC.</p><p>In August of 2017 life dealt me two perspective altering situations within a week: Hurricane Harvey and losing my job as a Corporate Security Analyst of 5 years. The loss of my position was heartbreaking but being surrounded by constant destruction brought on by an “800 year flood” kept me sane and sober. By December life had begun to return back to normal for most of us Houstonian’s, however something incredible was taking place with the price of Bitcoin: it was over $10,000/BTC!</p><p>The dramatic increase of volume plus pricing momentum within Bitcoin caused me to study value theory and seriously contemplate just wtf was going on. Whether it was serendipity, fate, or just plain dumb luck I discovered Giveth via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShzx6iqwus&amp;index=15&amp;list=PLIR2KLUqBsWnbhDZKi0S43Q5PnxFGdiEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube presentation</a> from Griff Green at the Ethereum Community Conference 2018. At this point all of my attention shifted studying pricing and volatility to determining how to best distribute trust.</p><p>Giveth will play a key role in enabling communities to distribute trust via decentralized governance. At a high level, Giveth can be viewed as software that enables communities to form causes and promote those causes via group determined milestones. Individuals who are part of a given community can spawn their own milestones, and via pledging of ETH to those milestones prioritize what is and is not important for that community with 100% transparency. Additionally those who give within this structure can be notified when their milestone is reached as well as delegate authority of their contribution to others within their community.</p><p>Giveth is not an ICO, a corporation, or a monolithic organization that promises to render aid while capturing the majority of users contributions in times of need (most charities). Giveth is an opportunity to do better by humanity via distributed trust within systems of decentralized governance that <!-- -->*<!-- -->anyone<!-- -->*<!-- --> can run.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/40f75102c422?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Meefs</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩</p><blockquote><p>~DAppLion</p></blockquote><p>🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧</p><p><strong>Why Giveth?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We believe in the power of communities to solve problems.</p><p>We believe in decentralized technology to unleash the creativity and energy of altruistic communities.</p><p>Giving is a humanitarian act of solidarity and empathy — we believe in the fundamental rights and dignity of every human being.</p><p>We are doing nothing less than reinventing giving!</p></blockquote><p><strong>What?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We build a platform for trust and transparency in giving.</p><p>Decentralized altruistic communities promote social innovation and create opportunities for people.</p><p>This platform is in strong contrast to the systems currently in place: bureaucratic, inflexible, centralized, with a lot of overhead</p></blockquote><p><strong>How?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We are enthusiastic and passionate — we do a hell of a lot of amazing stuff.</p><p>We are a community — open, transparent, cooperative, companionable and focused to deliver.</p><p>We are an active part of the Ethereum eco-system and contribute to the development of Ethereum.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Ron Mat</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️</p><blockquote><p><strong>“You can’t go around building a better world for people. Only people can build a better world. Otherwise it’s just a cage.” — Terry Pratchett</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want to understand what Giveth values are and what it means to be a Unicorn and to be part of the Giveth community, you has to understand that the simple goal of all Unicorns in the Giveth galaxy, all around the world is, to make the world a better place.</p><p>This starts with the fact that Giveth trusts in people, real, actual people.</p><p>Let me explain why this is an amazing, outstanding fact in 2018. We spend the last years and maybe generation with the trust in the big systems and cooperations. The (centralized) banking system, centralized political systems with so called “representatives of the people” who rule countries and do not even know any longer what is going on in a country, the idea that the fact that we are allowed to go to vote every 4 (or 5 years) is all it needs for a democracy to work. We trusted in this centralized systems to rule the world and sort out our human problems. What we end up with was a banking crisis, plastic rubbish all over the planet, a so called refugee crisis and more and more the distrust in systems. We trust in charity organizations all over the world to sort out what we humans fucked up in the past and wonder in the end that we do not know what happened with the donations that we made. We trusted in system for a long time, until we realized that this systems are not working out the way we wanted. We realized that no one will sort out all the rubbish in the oceans and at the beaches if we do not start doing it ourselves, more and more people realize that we need to take our power as citizens back to actually have a say in a democracy, we start to realize that it makes sense to have a reliable person we can trust instead of a bank. We start to realize that centralized systems do not work out the way we though. Decentralization and the trust in people, actually people are two of the main values of Giveth. All these people, all over the world, who contribute their love and time, their work and ideas into Giveth are Unicorns. People with ideas who want to be part of the movement to change the world and make it a better place are Unicorns.</p><p>Giveth wants to give power back to people while decentralizing systems. One of Giveths goals and values is to make a donation system transparent, complete and absolute. We want to make donations transparent, direct and reliable. And even if Giveth is a charity organization, we are not just talking about donations. We are talking about the structure of governance within the organization, about reliable, accountable people within the Giveth galaxy, about the fact that everyone and anyone can actively participate in the platform, the organization and the idea of Giveth. The future of giving is not just giving ether to a cause that needs support. Giving can of course be monetary but can also be work force, bodys, love, time, minds and ideas for the greater good.</p><p>A lot of people already volunteer for a good cause, give time and love to a project or an idea. Giveth is on the way to build a platform that allows any one of us to make a real change in our community, our neighborhood. I will be able to put up a cause that is important in my direct neighborhood and will make a change and a direct impact in my community — and you can too. Because, you not what? No one knows better what’s going on in your neighborhood than you. Why should anyone donate money to a big, intransparent organization that pays CEO’s instead of directly to your cause? Your community wants to teach kids how to code, you want to feed the homeless people, you want to gather a couple of people and pick up all the rubbish at your local beach/town/park? Cool, put up a cause on the Giveth platform and start to do so. Giveth believes and trusts in people and in you. This is the highest value any organization can have: the trust in people.</p><p>Shaping the future needs more than just a couple of people, it needs all of us, the human community. So we are calling everyone, to become a Unicorn and join us in the movement to #maketheworldabtterplace.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong> <a href="https://medium.com/u/7d328be176a3?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>jen Giveth</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌</p><blockquote><p><em>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>we were all going direct the other way”</em></a></p></blockquote><p><strong><em>–</em> in short the Unicorns were getting easier and easier to spot as they were coming together to reinvent the most fundamental thing there is.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Giveth is reinventing what it means to be human.</strong></p><p>Humans are not the only life form which create but we have made it our ultimate evolutionary skill. To create is to give and vice versa. Giving is the most primal expression of creating, the most basic level. To voluntarily give something that is yours ( mind, body, property…) by leaving your ownership it becomes something for somebody else. In other words : something changed, transformed, got created.</p><p>So giving, What’s so special about that? Everybody does it in one way or another. But the giving the Unicorns are talking about is voluntarily or coercion-free! This means no one can force you in any way. Nor are there gatekeepers who have the power to interfere in the process of you giving. The Giveth Unicorns credo is very clear :</p><p>• Donating can be simple, fun and effective.</p><p>• Transparency and accountability can be the default.</p><p>• Every idea has the potential to make a positive impact, and it can be heard and funded in a decentralized fashion.</p><p>• Every Donor can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.</p><p>• People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.</p><p>• Real change and innovation comes about when communities join together to make the world a better place.</p><p>Unicorns have always been elusive creatures but now the stars in the Giveth Galaxy have aligned and they are popping up everywhere. Everywhere people are noticing what is being built, being reinvented and want to contribute. The moment you give your time, your energy, your love to this community and project, and help in some way in its existence, a new Unicorn is born.</p><p>Permissionless creation will make us unstoppable. It gives hope for the future and the confidence that there will always be people who act for the good of others and that they will succeed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Xilef</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽</p><blockquote><p>There are restrictive walls that contain possibility. Inside these walls passion and motivation are strangled by bureaucracy, limitations, and unrelated political tethers. Giveth breaks down these walls and exposes possibility to the wide open expanse contained only by the one natural restriction, capacity. Giveth is where possibility meets capacity, where, passion and motivation are free to flourish and where only nature itself can restrain us.</p><p>Those with the passion to change the world sit on one side of a vast and long continent, on the other side are those who want to help them and have the resources to make their vision possible. Giveth is a canal right through the middle of that continent, removing the need to go all the way around and convincing more and more people on both sides to make the journey from the world we live in to the world we believe in.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Giveth is a decentralized platform that facilitates better giving and better receiving, contributing to creating a better world</li><li>Giveth creates increased transparency and allows results based giving for individual donors, in turn inspiring creation of more and more givers and more and more change makers</li><li>Giveth believes in connecting change makers with those who want to support their mission, allowing them to avoid the mission creep that comes with chasing semi-related funding</li><li>Giveth believes in decentralized, democratic, liquid control of donor funds</li><li>Giveth believes in maximizing each gifts potential, utilizing blockchain technology to decrease administrative cost requirements</li><li>Giveth believes in giving change makers the funds and trust they need to make the change they want to see a reality</li></ul><blockquote><p>~<a href="https://medium.com/u/5d71f4e010d?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Williams</a></p></blockquote><p>🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗</p><blockquote><p>Unicorns, previously thought of as being as elusive as they are mysterious and wondrous are in actuality easier to see than one would think and you even possess what it takes to be one. With transparency at the height of their values, however, they are just as easily looked past as they are open with their ability to share and positively impact their world. Hiding in the plain sight of the blockchain forests, these Unicorns believe in a simplicity that allow the moving parts of the world they believe in to glide seamlessly together without the need of a centralized force to guide them. They hope to give the power over sharing and donation out to the very people participating in order to stimulate a positive change of attitude and integrity for the <strong>Decentralized Altruistic Communities</strong> that they are a part of. By using this value system based on participation, innovation, transparency, and accountability the Giveth Unicorns hope to use smart contracts to put donors in charge of how their funds are used, they hope to allow that direct relationship to create a rewarding system for all who are involved so that positivity is felt at the very core of each donation. Giveth Unicorns know that sharing should feel good and that goodness has the ability to shift attitudes of the world for the better, for a more common force toward one another acting accountable and responsible for what they are putting out into the place we’re all a part of.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Zak Perna</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨</p><blockquote><p>Dear Galaxy,</p><p>If you’re reading this we’ve done it, all the work the Unicorn troopers fought for was not in vain.</p><p><strong>The mission we set out to accomplish was clear:</strong></p><p><em>Create a trustless system of self governing bodies, capable of uniting around causes they choose to support.</em></p><p><em>Build a platform that fosters experimentation, collaboration and open source initiatives.</em></p><p><em>Awaken the Giver within all the citizen of this Galaxy and beyond, by showing them how and where their contributions make a difference.</em></p><p>The Centralization forces were determined to keep the Galaxy under their control, well we couldn’t let that happen, not for our sake and the sake of generations to come.</p><p>To accomplish our mission we had to do something greater than simply unseating the unjust forces.</p><p>We had to show them a better way!</p><p><strong>The way of the Unicorn.</strong></p><p>We started a battle that will never end, the fight for truth, justice and transparency between citizens and powers is one that must live on forever.</p><p>It’s up to you to keep this fight alive all throughout your Galaxy, to inspire, incite and expose the truth for all to see.</p><p>This was the cause we chose to fight for, the one we believed mattered most to our generation.</p><p>Now it’s your turn to decide, what will you fight for?</p><p>We’ve given you the tools to sculpt your future, to build your community and free yourselves.</p><p>Use them wisely and never, EVER…… <strong>Forget!</strong></p><p><strong>The way of the</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/YalorMewn/status/992864729407291392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Unicorn</strong></a> ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/33144025168f?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Yalor Tackson</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗</p><blockquote><p>Giveth is a global community focused on improving the world through blockchain technology.</p><p>Trustless systems like a distributed ledger allow us to eliminate the middle man, cut down costs and provide transparency and accountability.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oxfam, consistently rated <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.uk/blogs/2012/01/oxfam-number-three-in-top-100-best-ngos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the best NGOs in the world</a> and a household name in most western countries, is mired in a scandal over allegedly <a href="http://nationalpost.com/news/world/a-full-on-caligula-orgy-oxfam-charity-accused-of-exploiting-haiti-disaster-victims-for-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abusing of both people and funds</a> in Haiti during the aid mission deployed after the hurricane Harvey. Not only this, but it is also accused of its employees exchanging aid for sexual favours, plain and simple sexual abuse. The case has opened the door for a cry of the nonprofit sector to uncover and denounce these practises, which seem to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2018/feb/14/oxfam-allegations-are-tip-of-iceberg-sexual-harassment-and-aid-workers-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more common than one would think</a>.</p><p>Transparency and accountability in charitable donations have been put in check after the scandal broke out, with the International Development Secretary of the UK announcing a big audit of the organizations funded by public money, under <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-sexual-abuse-aid-workers-haiti-prostitutes-scandal-national-crime-agency-mordaunt-latest-a8211211.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat of cutting the funding</a> if their standards are not met. Presumably, such an audit will be expensive and will not bring much to light, as the system is fundamentally opaque, spending more taxpayers’ money that could be dedicated to social impact projects.</p><p>Despite some challenges, I genuinely believe that almost every person working in the development sector is in it to help other people and that they do the best they can. Until now, we didn’t have tools that allowed for a different governance and management of large amounts of aid funds… but now we do.</p><h1>Campaign-based giving</h1><p>Nowadays, one gives money to an organization and must trust them to use it properly. The money is given a priori, being a grant from the government, from a granting organization or from individuals. Once the money is in their bank account, it’s -by design of how the banking system works- opaque to external people: we must trust them again to have proper procedures in place to avoid mismanagement of such funds i.e. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oxfam-in-haiti-it-was-like-a-caligula-orgy-with-prostitutes-in-oxfam-t-shirts-p32wlk0rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Caligula orgy with prostitutes in Oxfam T-shirts”</a>.</p><p>With <a href="http://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth</a> you will be able to see how the project is laid out, <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milestone by Milestone</a>, and how much money is required for each and every part. If a Milestone is not achieved, or the Milestone Reviewers (more on this category of validators shortly) perceive misconduct, 1) this Milestone will not be approved and paid out and 2) the Reviewer can decide to send all of the unspent funds back to the original Givers to be donated to other projects.</p><p>The most common issue raised here is: what happens if the Milestone Reviewer(s) is/are ‘greased’ by the Milestone Manager to approve an underachieved Milestone or to turn a blind eye on inappropriate behaviour? I see this as an excellent opportunity to bring together agents that have no special interest in colluding: a grassroots organization, the local community leadership, the government and an independent observer. One could decide that all of these need to agree on the validation and submit proof, similar to the videos used in Giveth’s <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RewardDAO</a>. Technically, since the figure of the Reviewer is just an Ethereum address, it can be a contract, it could be a multisig wallet held by these relevant stakeholders. Another, if slightly more complex, setup is that a percentage of all Givers to a Campaign need to approve the Milestone after reviewing proof. Using a <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Democracy</a> governance system here would naturally concentrate voting power in people that are reputable and are perceived to be neutral in this particular Campaign or even Milestone.</p><p>I see this as a side benefit of Giveth’s Campaigns: the need to be in constant communication with Milestone Reviewers and Campaign Managers creates — apart from transparency — a true Community where problems are openly discussed and input comes from all sides, because everyone has stake in the game.</p><h1>Communities solving problems</h1><p>Thinking of the bigger picture, how can we really shake the giving ‘industry’ awake? Without questioning the expertise and indubitable economies of scale and know-how transfer of the big International NGOs, Giveth enables another sort of organization: The DAC, the <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decentralized Altruistic Community</a>. Can we do better than just trust Oxfam (or any equivalent INGO) to drop out of the air and deploy their tactics? The Giveth platform can be used for validation of Campaigns and Milestones, but … maybe we could go a step further.</p><p>Imagine the creation of a true DAC in Haiti, conformed by Givers, people on the ground (the ‘Makers’) and even representation of the INGOs, all communicating with each other and through an agreed form of governance that works to pledge resources the right way. This way we can make sure that Oxfam’s expertise is allocated where it can impact the most, in constant communication with other stakeholders and with fully transparent decision making.</p><h1>You get some decision power, you get some more, and you get some too!</h1><p>Does it sound complicated? After all, you are not an expert in Haiti… maybe you’ve never even been there! How are you supposed to choose where to pledge funds or to know which Campaigns are going to be the most impactful? Giveth has got you covered. With Liquid Pledging, a concept derived from <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid democracy</a>, you can delegate the choice of your donations to Communities you perceive as experts: this can be an influential development group — Oxfam if you really must!- but also your former roommate’s social impact group, which was really into this ‘making a better world’ thing. You delegate to a DAC, and it can send your donation to its chosen Campaign, a lot like how charity is supposed to work nowadays, but with much more oversight. You will be able to track your donation, veto any decisions the delegates make and get connected to the people/communities running the Campaigns you will be funding.</p><p>Once you start down the rabbit hole, the possibilities are endless: You can delegate half of your pledged funds to a DAC specializing in disaster relief, which in turn will fund some trusted Campaigns for smaller specific problems. The other half you can delegate to your favourite Campaign focusing on improving education in your hometown or even to another DAC that brings together all education projects in your area. Be as local or global as you want!</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Liquid pledging at work" src="/img/blog/liquidPledging.png" class="img_E7b_"><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="liquid-pledging-at-work">Liquid pledging at work<a class="hash-link" href="#liquid-pledging-at-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><h1>Help us solve the challenges</h1><p>The future is near.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img loading="lazy" alt="Liquid Democracy" src="/img/blog/liquidDemocracy.jpeg" class="img_E7b_"><p>Welcome to the future of voting.</p><p>Or as some would say the Land of Possibilities :-)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="so-what-is-liquid-democracy">So what IS liquid democracy?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-what-is-liquid-democracy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In addition to being simply a system of tokenized voting you can think of it as a hybrid between representative and direct democracy.</p><p>Instead of one person casting one vote, the system can become fractional. One vote can now be split in any number of ways between multiple delegates or sent entirely to your chosen delegate, and your delegate can delegate to someone else. Much delegation, so democracy.</p><p>As an example take a busy college student who just doesn’t have time to vote, she could delegate ½ her vote to her mom and ½ her vote to her professor. If either of them wanted they could allocate a portion of the vote or all of it to a popular politically active persona that acts as a representative for the local community and controls an influential % of the total vote.</p><h1>Giveth is a perfect playground for implementing liquid democracy</h1><p>Of course, the reason we’re explaining liquid democracy is because it is one of the core technologies that inspired Giveth’s <a href="https://github.com/Giveth/liquidpledging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Pledging</a> system, and we see it as an important building block for the governance of <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACs</a>.</p><p>While there is no voting inherent in Giveth’s base layer, there is an opportunity to use a governance system like liquid democracy in the various roles that are filled currently by people such as <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delegates or Reviewers</a>. This would mean that that a delegate, instead of being one person, would become a smart contract that has liquid democracy built in so that the donors can elect several delegates to decide which projects get funded (we will likely use a “liquid plutocracy” model, the more you donate the more votes you get).</p><p>But wait there’s more, with liquid democracy + blockchain you have the ability to actually codify your vote.</p><p>Yes, I know, code what?</p><p>Codifying your vote could allow you to tag different delegates to represent you based on the subject matter for the initiative. This means that if one initiative has an economic tag your vote for that initiative would be automatically allocated to the delegate you want to represent you on the economic issues, if another initiative carries the environmental tag your vote would be automatically allocated to your environmental delegate. Very diverse, much effective.</p><p>Say an important issue comes up that you feel very strongly about. You can push a button and take your voting back and vote yourself, then push a button and put your delegation settings back the way they were.</p><p>You set the term limits, you can delegate for 20 seconds or 20 years!</p><p>Liquid democracy gives everybody the ability to delegate their vote accordingly or even to overstep the position of their representative keeping them accountable for their actions on a day to day spectrum instead of year to year.</p><p>No one knows exactly what the future of voting looks like, but with Giveth we can start experimenting with this incredible model while making the world a better place at the same time! Much vast, many possibility, sooo future!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="democracy-30-for-the-transparent-world"><a href="https://medium.com/decentfund/democracy-3-0-for-the-transparent-world-5a9f1ffad1ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democracy 3.0 For The Transparent World</a><a class="hash-link" href="#democracy-30-for-the-transparent-world" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>(Updated 11/20 ) Excellent article by <a href="https://medium.com/u/bc1f295769e2?source=post_page-----bd3c63e8df52--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Igor Line</a> on the varied benefits of Liquid Democracy.</p><p>To find out more about liquid democracy and how you can experiment within Giveth:</p><ul><li>Join us on <a href="http://join.giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riot or Slack</a></li><li>Discover our <a href="http://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Site</a> and <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a></li><li>Fork our code on <a href="http://github.com/Giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a></li><li>Follow us on <a href="http://medium.com/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Edit: for the current status of the development, more recent updates</em> <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/tagged/dappening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a></p><p>If you ever talked to a Giveth <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unicorn</a> chances are high we did not let you go before you understood what Giveth is all about — we’re a passionate bunch. If you haven’t met people like <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrifft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griff Green</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jbaylina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordi Baylina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceTorrellas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace Torrellas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vojtechsimetka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vojtech Simetka</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/team-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many other great faces</a> contributing to the Giveth Platform you might wonder <strong>what it is exactly we’re building and why.</strong></p><p>To put it plain and simple: we want to make the <strong>process of giving to causes you believe in effective and transparent</strong>, and we are using blockchain technology to do so. In <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2016</a> the team started developing the DApp (Donation Application) and is now <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coming closer</a> to the release of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In the build-up to this, we would like to take a moment to explain why we are creating the platform and give you a sneak peak of the user flow.</p><p><strong>Wait, but why?</strong></p><p>If you have ever donated to non-profits or charitable organizations chances are high your experience was similar to this one: on your way to the metro you got stopped by a convincing youth who got your name, mailing address and signature for a fixed monthly donation to a specific cause. Since that moment, a few times per year — if you’re lucky — you receive an old-school newsletter which you throw away without reading. <strong>You are left entirely in the dark about where your donation went,</strong> and the non-profit receives a monthly amount until you decide to cancel.</p><p>Giveth changes all this. As all donations are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain you can follow, in real-time, who gets your donations and why at a very granular level.</p><p>The Giveth platform has a simple result-based incentive structure: when funds are collected they are stored in our <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-vault-contract-open-sourced-by-giveth-fe2261f7b91b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault</a> and only after Milestones are completed, can the funds be withdrawn. The Giver’s funds are under their control until their donations are locked for a specific purpose.</p><p>This basic structure gives them a clear view on the various people involved in the process and the possibility to contact everyone directly. And if they don’t like what their funds are intended to be used for, they have time to block its use.</p><p>We are building the <strong>Future of Giving by cutting out the bureaucracy</strong> so that funds can be spent more efficiently and everyone can collaborate in making the world a better place.</p><p><strong>Talk the Talk</strong></p><p>We are re-engineering how donations are made, and with it, we had to reinvent the <a href="http://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language</a> to talk about it. The 3 key building blocks of the Giveth system are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones. A <strong>DAC</strong> — short for Decentralized Altruistic Community — is the group of people united around a cause they want to support. This DAC will fund and steer multiple <strong>Campaigns</strong>, which can in their turn also be supported by more than one DAC. A Campaign translates the dreams of a DAC into a more specific agenda to which action points are linked: we call these the <strong>Milestones</strong>. Milestones are the smallest entity within the Giveth system and are the last step in our donation flow. Once completed, the funds are released into the wild to reimburse and reward good people for their good work.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Building Blocks of Giveth" src="/img/blog/buildingBlocksGiveth.png" class="img_E7b_"><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-3-key-building-blocks-of-giveth-are-communities-dacs-campaigns-and-milestones">The 3 key building blocks of Giveth are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-3-key-building-blocks-of-giveth-are-communities-dacs-campaigns-and-milestones" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>We focus on the technology so people can focus entirely on uniting around causes. In order to do so, we need to define <strong>some of the basic roles</strong> in our system.</p><p>A <strong>Giver</strong> can donate directly to a Campaign they believe in, or can decide to pledge funds to a DAC that will allocate these funds to appropriate Campaigns in the Giver’s name — we call this process <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid pledging</a>. By donating, the Giver automatically becomes part of the DAC and is connected with the rest of the community.</p><p>The <strong>Delegates</strong> are registered DAC members that take on the task of allocating funds sent to their DAC to one or more Campaigns.</p><p>The <strong>Makers</strong> are all the people within these campaigns making the change the DACs want to see in the world. There are a few specific roles the Makers have to fulfill.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Campaign Managers</strong> are the Makers that create Campaigns, assign funds to specific Milestones and make sure their specific Campaign is a success.</li><li>The <strong>Milestone Managers</strong> are the Makers in charge of specific Milestones and need to assure these very specific actions are achieved as described.</li><li>The <strong>Recipients</strong> are the Makers that receive the funds when a Milestone is successfully completed.</li></ul><img loading="lazy" alt="Giveth Roles" src="/img/blog/givingBlogRoles1.png" class="img_E7b_"><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="main-roles-within-the-giveth-platform-giver-delegate-campaign-manager-milestone-manager-recipient">Main roles within the Giveth Platform: Giver, Delegate, Campaign Manager, Milestone Manager, Recipient.<a class="hash-link" href="#main-roles-within-the-giveth-platform-giver-delegate-campaign-manager-milestone-manager-recipient" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Two additional roles have been created to <strong>guarantee the correct usage of funds</strong>.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Campaign Reviewer</strong> can reject completion of any Milestone and can, as a strong security measure, even cancel a whole Campaign if it appears to be fraudulent.</li><li>The <strong>Milestone Reviewer</strong>’s role is to confirm the Milestone Manager really achieved the proposed goal or action described in the Milestone.</li></ul><p>This brings us to the <strong>true power</strong> of the Giveth platform: at all times the Giver knows exactly what is happening to the donated funds, how these are being spent and is in full control through a <strong>transparent network of accountabilities</strong>. If a Milestone is canceled, the funds are returned to the Campaign. If a Campaign is canceled, the funds are automatically returned to the Delegates that supported it. If a Delegate quits, the funds are returned to the Giver. On top of this, one of the most revolutionary aspects of this system is that at any point up until the moment funds are locked into a Campaign, the Giver can decide to withdraw them.</p><img loading="lazy" alt="Giveth Additonal Roles" src="/img/blog/givingBlogRoles2.png" class="img_E7b_"><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="two-extra-roles-guarantee-the-correct-usage-of-funds-campaign-reviewer-and-milestone-reviewer">Two extra roles guarantee the correct usage of funds: Campaign Reviewer and Milestone Reviewer.<a class="hash-link" href="#two-extra-roles-guarantee-the-correct-usage-of-funds-campaign-reviewer-and-milestone-reviewer" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>You can discover more about these roles and responsibilities by reading on in <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the product definition</a> on our wiki.</p><p><strong>Walk the Walk</strong></p><p>The Giveth Donation Application is <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now in beta stage on testnet</a>, with all of the roles described above integrated, and currently undergoing testing with a select team of volunteers.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPXoEzuNQzc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="giveth-co-founder-griff-green-explains-what-the-giveth-donation-application-is-about">Giveth co-founder Griff Green explains what the Giveth Donation Application is about.<a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-co-founder-griff-green-explains-what-the-giveth-donation-application-is-about" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>We always have opportunities for skilled developers to contribute to our project, and you can <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donate</a> to <!-- -->`<!-- -->revolution.eth<!-- -->`<!-- --> to reward and incentivize the devs that are making the Giveth platform a reality.
