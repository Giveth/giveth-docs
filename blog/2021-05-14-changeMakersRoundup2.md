We asked our community to add their projects to [giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) and [share their stories](2021-04-15-change-makers.md) about how they are changing the world for the better using #giveth4change. Keep reading for our second round of submissions, or [submit your story](2021-04-15-change-makers.md) via [twitter](https://twitter.com/Givethio) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/) to be featured in our next round up.

<img alt="The Commons Simulator" src={useBaseUrl('img/blog/commonsSimulator.png')}  />

## **The Commons Simulator**

is a gamified computation tool powered by a cadCAD backend that blends art and simulation into a choose-your-own-adventure sci-fi storyline. In the game, you travel back in time to use cadCAD as a tool to help a community design a regenerative Commons with the potential to save the world from total planetary and economic destruction. The first level is live and you can play it right now on [https://sim.commonsstack.org](https://sim.commonsstack.org).

Developed by the Commons Stack Dev community, the Commons Simulator illustrates one of the core missions of the Commons Stack: Empowering communities to design their own economies using open source simulation tools. Donations to this project on Giveth will go towards expanding the game by adding another level with a new story and new mechanics, such as the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751).

<img alt="Njombe Beyond" src={useBaseUrl('img/blog/njombeBeyond.png')}  />

## **Njombe Beyond**


aims to tackle waste management challenges in Njombe, a town of 40,000 in southwest Tanzania. A common challenge in Tanzania is solid waste management, including in Njombe. Mettodo, the project’s creator states:

> ‘ 35 tons of solid waste is generated daily by the town: 28 tons are taken to a dumpsite, where the waste is usually burned . . . 10 % of the solid waste is plastic waste: 3,500 kg of per day, which is equal to 1000 tons of plastic waste every year.’

Njombe Beyond is working hard to reduce the plastic wasted in Njombe town. Their three specific objectives are:

*   Establish a small scale value chain for recycling plastics within the local community.
*   Collaborate with stakeholders of the program and ensure fair working conditions.
*   Involve schools and local communities in Njombe Beyond to bring awareness to the problems and opportunities of plastic waste.

When we first set out on the change-maker campaign we had decided to wrap things up on the 12th of May, but after some discussion we have decided to **extend the change-maker campaign** indefinitely. It’s an amazing opportunity to engage with our community and celebrate the amazing projects happening on [Giveth.io](http://giveth.io). If you’d like to learn how to participate [check out the original medium post](2021-04-15-change-makers.md) for more details on getting your project featured in our submission round-ups!
