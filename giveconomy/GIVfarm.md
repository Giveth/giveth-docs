The GIVfarm launched on **December 24, 2021**. 3.5% of the total token supply, 35 Million GIV, has been allocated to the first GIVfarm round of 6 months. Farms are available on either **Ethereum Mainnet (ETH)** or **xDai Network**. Any farms you stake tokens into will yield GIV rewards and add to your [GIVstream flowrate](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream) only for that corresponding chain. GIV reward distribution for the 6 pools available is as follows:



| Pool                          | Tokens Allocated |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| GIV/ETH Uniswap v3 on Mainnet | 10 Million GIV   |
|80GIV/20ETH Balancer on Mainnet|2.5 Million GIV|
|GIV Staking on Mainnet|2.5 Million GIV|
|GIV/HNY Honeyswap on xDai|10 Million GIV|
|GIV/WETH Sushiswap on xDai|2.5 Million GIV|
|GIVgardens Staking on xDai|7.5 Million GIV|



The amount claimable from rewards on the day of launch will be 10% with the other 90% allocated to flow out from the GIVstream. The GIVstream will flow for 5 years and as time passes, the greater the amount immediately claimable from rewards will be. As you earn rewards in the GIVfarm, you also increase the flow rate of your GIVstream.

Further rounds may be launched after this period that could contain new pools and changes in distribution. All rewards from GIVfarm will be affected by the GIVstream. Read up on the [GIVstream documentation](./givstream) for more information.

### _*A note on Uniswap v3 Farms:_
Harvesting NFT rewards from Uni v3 collects rewards from all your NFTs staked (if you staked more than one). In this process each NFT is unstaked, rewards are harvested and your NFT is re-staked. If you have multiple NFTs this can become a gas intensive process.

When you Unstake your NFT you also harvest your rewards, If you have multiple NFTs staked when you Unstake one, you only harvest rewards from the single unstaked NFT.
