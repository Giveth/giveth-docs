“The Givers” NFT’s are not just NFT’s but integrated Giveth PFPs! Giveth's first PFP collection was a [community proposed initiative](https://forum.giveth.io/t/the-givers-the-giveth-ecosystem-pfp-collection/478) begun in March 2022. The intention of the PFP collection is to raise funds for the Giveth DAO and continue our mission of building the Future of Giving. The Givers was launched for public minting on March 24, 2023 at 11am CST.

**To mint a Giver head on over to [the minting page](https://giveth.io/nft)**!

### About the Giveth DAO
Since 2016, Giveth has focused on supporting public goods through a community-driven ecosystem of collective support and value creation. This has resulted in streamlined donation tools and mechanisms powered by blockchain technology, which have onboarded over 1,700 projects and has facilitated hundreds of thousands of donations.

We’re launching the Givers PFP collection as a fundraiser to allow us to continue improving our donation platform and build tools that empower non-profits and impact projects.

## Supply & Minting

There will be a total of 1,250 NFTs in the collection, and no more than 100 of them will be used for promotional purposes by the DAO. Minting can be done on Ethereum Mainnet for 100 DAI each. To ensure an even distribution, no single address can hold more than 5 Givers PFPs.

## Art parameters

Every art NFT is created out of several individual layers of artwork. In some cases some of the layered artwork may be unseen as they get covered by others above it, as for instance the art tattoos. You will however be able to see all of your unique art's traits and rarity on Rarible or in the token's metadata.


## Secondary Market

You can trade your Giver but keep in mind that for any trades on the secondary market, a 10% royalty fee will be imposed. All Givers (unless stated otherwise) are licensed under Creative Commons CC0 or "No Rights Reserved". The easiest way to trade is using the [Rarible Collection Page](https://rarible.com/the-givers-pfp/items).
