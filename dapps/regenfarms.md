# RegenFarms
[RegenFarms](https://giveth.io/givfarm) is the next generation of ReFi liquidity mining opportunities for DAOs and regens alike. Using our contracts for the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm) and the [GIVstream](https://giveth.io/givstream), we are empowering other for-good DAOs to launch liquidity mining incentive programs, “RegenFarms”, with streams of their own.
## Background
Utilizing the [GIVstream](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream), all rewards earned in the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm) (until December 23, 2026) include some part liquid and some part streaming. This allows the GIVfarm to offer high APRs without creating excessive sell pressure. Thanks to the GIVstream, Giveth has pioneered an elegant evolution to traditional liquidity mining that offers lucrative rewards while attracting and rewarding long-term hodlers, and keeping participants invested in the project for years to come. 
## For Interested DAOs
We are now offering this technology [as a service](https://forum.giveth.io/t/crazy-idea-stream-as-a-service-giviverse-multiverse-now-called-regenfarms/295) to other [Blockchain4Good](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blockchain4good&src=typed_query) DAOs! Interested DAOs must be able to prove that they are a “Regen Economy”, i.e., are creating a positive impact for society such as by supporting or building public goods in some way. **If your DAO is interested in applying to kickstart a RegenFarm, [fill out this form](https://giveth.typeform.com/regenfarms).**
We use [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/giv.eth/) to get approval from GIV token holders before accepting a new DAO for RegenFarms. Once accepted, the interested DAO will need to work with our team to provide their RegenFarm [parameters](https://www.notion.so/giveth/Regen-Farm-Parameters-a5b474e75f334d03ad1c1c43f5d923d4) and the funds to kickstart their farm.
## Use of Funds
RegenFarm DAOs provide the funds to reward their Liquidity Providers. Before initiating the farm, 1% of these funds are sent to the [Giveth liquidity multisig](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xf924fF0f192f0c7c073161e0d62CE7635114e74f/transactions) to support $GIV and the GIVeconomy, and an additional 1% of these funds are sent to the [Giveth Matching Pool](https://giveth.io/project/donation-eth) to fund donations to verified for-good projects on the [Giveth donation platform](https://giveth.io/projects).
## RegenFarms UI

Liquidity mining opportunities for RegenFarms can be found on the [GIVfarm page](https://giveth.io/givfarm). You can provide liquidity (by following the “provide liquidity” link at the bottom of the card) and stake LP tokens to begin earning rewards. When you "harvest" your earnings, the liquid part will be sent to your wallet, and the streaming part will kickstart your corresponding RegenStream. Liquid rewards earned from your RegenStream are claimable at the bottom right. Note that when you harvest rewards from the RegenFarm card, all liquid rewards from your RegenStream are also sent to your wallet.
