Giveth is building a culture of giving that empowers and rewards those who give -- to projects, to society, and to the world. We aim to inspire our community to participate in an ecosystem of collective support, abundance and value-creation. **Welcome to the GIVeconomy.**

## About GIV

GIV is the governance token that fuels and directs the GIVeconomy. GIV holders are empowered to collectively coordinate around shared resources and fund initiatives that shape the Future of Giving.

At launch, our community can participate in the GIVeconomy in the following ways:
- From December 24, 2021 onward, eligible recipients can claim their [**GIVdrop**](./givdrop) on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network).
- Donors to [verified projects](https://giveth.io/projects) on Giveth get rewards from [**GIVbacks**](./givbacks).
- Liquidity providers and stakers can earn rewards in the [**GIVfarm**](./givfarm).
- Anyone who claims GIV from their participation in the GIVeconomy gets a continuous flow of GIV from the [**GIVstream**](./givstream) until December 23, 2026.
- You can stake your GIV to get [**GIVpower**](./givpower) and boost projects you love, increase their rank and increasing the amount of GIVbacks given to their donors.

### Distribution

An amount of 1 billion GIV tokens were minted at the onset of the GIVeconomy. 100 million of the GIV tokens are liquid and available for use immediately, and the other 900 million have been allocated to the [GIVstream](./givstream) and are being released continuously throughout the entire "GIViverse" over a period of 5 years (until December 23, 2026). The distribution of the total supply of GIV throughout the GIViverse is outlined in the following graphic:

The GIVeconomy has been built thanks to our dedicated community of Givers. Giveth has been growing since 2016 on a foundation of donations, time, skills, sweat, generosity & love! We are proud to launch an economy by and for the donors, with no money gleaned from presales or venture capitalists.

## The GIVeconomy Future

The launch of GIVeconomy with all the features described above is only the beginning - we are already crafting the next phase of the Future of Giving. We're developing systems that will completely change the way societies create and reward the creation of public goods.

Keep reading to learn more about some of the raw, exciting and beautiful ideas that we intend to bring to fruition. If you want to have a hand in shaping the next generation of philanthropy, start to [explore GIVeconomy](https://giveth.io/) and [join our team](https://giveth.io/join)!

### **GURVES**
Our biggest dream is to support for-good projects on Giveth to become their own microeconomies. The idea is when a donor gives to a verified project on Giveth, they get some GIV from the GIVbacks program. When this happens, some GIV is put into a [bonding curve](https://thegraph.academy/curators/introduction-to-bonding-curves/) that is uniquely generated for the project. The donor then receives freshly minted "project tokens" from the bonding curve. Projects are in effect being gifted their own token economy, opening up endless possibilities for incentives and system design!
