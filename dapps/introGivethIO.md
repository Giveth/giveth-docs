# Intro to Giveth.io

The current version of Giveth.io, [launched in March 2021](https://medium.com/giveth/the-future-of-giving-is-here-d480388a3338), offers a simple and streamlined way for the world to donate to for-good projects via the Ethereum Blockchain. This is the culmination of years of experience that started in early 2017 when [we launched the first smart contract donation platform on Ethereum](https://blog.giveth.io/giveth-donation-3-0-the-soft-launch-bf00d3bddca8).

[Giveth.io](https://giveth.io) boasts a smooth onboarding process for donors and projects. Creating a project can be done in minutes, making donations can be done in seconds. Finding quality projects making social or environmental change is easy.

Our Donation Application uses a direct peer-to-peer donation framework; funds donated are sent to the project owner's Ethereum address. Giveth does not collect any fees from interactions on the platform.

Giveth.io is currently deployed on both Ethereum mainnet and Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network).

## Verification

Great projects make Giveth thrive! We have a Project Verification process to ensure that we have top quality, credible projects on the DApp. When your project becomes verified your donors become eligible for GIVbacks. Learn more about [GIVbacks here](./givbacks.md)
