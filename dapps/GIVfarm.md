The GIVfarm launched on **December 24, 2021**. 3.5% of the total token supply, 35 Million GIV, has been allocated to the first GIVfarm round of 6 months, 65 million tokens are held in a multisig for future liquidity provision. Farms are available on either **Ethereum Mainnet (ETH)** or **Gnosis Chain** (formerly xDai Network). Any farms you stake tokens into will yield GIV rewards and add to your [GIVstream flowrate](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream) only for that corresponding chain. GIV reward distribution for the 6 pools available is as follows:

| Pool                          | Tokens Allocated |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
|80GIV/20ETH Balancer on Mainnet|2.5 Million GIV|
|GIV Staking on Mainnet|2.5 Million GIV|
|GIV/HNY Honeyswap on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network)|10 Million GIV|
|GIV/WETH Sushiswap on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network)|2.5 Million GIV|
|GIVgardens Staking on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network)|7.5 Million GIV|

### A Note:  
10 Million GIV was originally allocated as rewards for a GIV/ETH Uniswap V3 pool on Mainnet. However, we detected one actor that was abusing a vulnerability in the system to earn rewards disproportionately and then dump the GIV. The community voted to terminate the Univ3 rewards program ([snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/giv.eth/proposal/0xfad6aa3baa36d5f2d7acdf135752aafca06201b77a80aee79baf6ff3f5bbaae5)), and they were shut off on March 21st, 2022. You can learn more about it [here](https://twitter.com/Givethio/status/1505981603293585410).
:::

The amount claimable from rewards on the day of launch will be 10% with the other 90% allocated to flow out from the GIVstream. The GIVstream will flow for 5 years, and as time passes, the greater the amount immediately claimable from rewards will be. As you earn rewards in the GIVfarm, you also increase the flow rate of your GIVstream.

## GIVfarming the GIVgarden
The GIVeconomy implements a unique feature in its GIV Staking pool on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network). When you stake tokens in this farm, you are also wrapping those GIV in the GIVgarden. This means that while collecting rewards from the GIVfarm, you also unlock voting power within the [GIVgarden](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0xb25f0ee2d26461e2b5b3d3ddafe197a0da677b98) as long as you stay staked in this farm. Conversely, while wrapping GIV in the GIVgarden you are also staking tokens into the aforementioned GIV staking pool.

Note that, as a result of the termination of the Univ3 rewards program in week 13 there is approximately 5M GIV, previously earmarked for these rewards, that are no longer part of the GIVfarm allocation.

Further rounds may be launched after this period that could contain new pools and changes in distribution. All rewards from GIVfarm will be affected by the GIVstream. Read up on the [GIVstream documentation](./givstream) for more information.
