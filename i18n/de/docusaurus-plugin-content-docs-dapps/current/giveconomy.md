Giveth is building a culture of giving that empowers and rewards those who give -- to projects, to society, and to the world. We aim to inspire our community to participate in an ecosystem of collective support, abundance and value-creation. **Welcome to the GIVeconomy.**

## About GIV

GIV is the governance token that fuels and directs the GIVeconomy. GIV holders are empowered to collectively coordinate around shared resources and fund initiatives that shape the Future of Giving.

At launch, our community can participate in the GIVeconomy in the following ways:
- From December 24, 2021 onward, eligible recipients can claim their [**GIVdrop**](./givdrop) on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network).
- Donors to [verified projects](https://giveth.io/projects) on Giveth get rewards from [**GIVbacks**](./givbacks).
- Liquidity providers and stakers can earn rewards in the [**GIVfarm**](./givfarm).
- All GIV holders can create and/or vote on proposals in the [**GIVgarden**](./givgarden).
- Anyone who claims GIV from their participation in the GIVeconomy gets a continuous flow of GIV from the [**GIVstream**](./givstream) until December 23, 2026.

### Distribution

An amount of 1 billion GIV tokens were minted at the onset of the GIVeconomy. 100 million of the GIV tokens are liquid and available for use immediately, and the other 900 million have been allocated to the [GIVstream](./givstream) and are being released continuously throughout the entire "GIViverse" over a period of 5 years (until December 23, 2026). The distribution of the total supply of GIV throughout the GIViverse is outlined in the following graphic:

The GIVeconomy has been built thanks to our dedicated community of Givers. Giveth has been growing since 2016 on a foundation of donations, time, skills, sweat, generosity & love! We are proud to launch an economy by and for the donors, with no money gleaned from presales or venture capitalists.

## The GIVeconomy Future

The launch of the GIVeconomy with all the features described above is only the beginning - we are already crafting the next phase of the Future of Giving. We're developing systems that will completely change the way societies create and reward the creation of public goods.

Keep reading to learn more about the raw, exciting and beautiful ideas that we intend to bring to fruition. If you want to have a hand in shaping the next generation of philanthropy, start to [explore the GIVeconomy](https://giveth.io/giveconomy) and [join our community](https://giveth.io/join)!

### Gurves

A major problem that exists within today’s society is that public goods creators rely on donations and, ultimately, sacrifice to get by. Unlike in the private goods sector, there are no market dynamics in the public goods sector to drive innovation and growth.

The GIV token will introduce the power of open markets to the public goods sector through Gurves. Gurves will use [bonding curves](https://thegraph.academy/curators/introduction-to-bonding-curves/) to enable projects to launch their own GIV-backed microeconomies, connected to the real-world value they provide. Bonding curves are smart contracts that hold collateral and mint or burn tokens according to a mathematically determined price curve. This provides stability to the new project’s token economy and built-in liquidity.

Gurves will allow projects to tokenize their impact and, thanks to the [augmented bonding curve](https://www.commonsstack.org/augmented-bonding-curve), will offer built-in revenue streams that thrive with speculation.

Gurves is our biggest dream and the central point of our [long-term roadmap](https://blog.giveth.io/evolving-nonprofits-into-regen-economies-f8282f97f8d3).
