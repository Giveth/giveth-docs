# Conflict Resolution Working Group

A working group of Gravitons who implement Gravity and provide education and support around conscious communication, empathic listening, and issue revelation and alleviation.

We aim to bring people together and promote resilience in the Giveth DAO by training our members in non-violent communication, understanding and analyzing conflict and techniques to manage it (internally, individually and collectively). The mission is to help build a culture of wellbeing and high vibes, while also pointing out clear steps to strategically manage disputes whenever they arise.


### What is Gravity?

Gravity aims to establish a culture of voluntary compliance around Giveth‚Äôs [Community Covenant](/whatisgiveth/covenant), [Code of Conduct](/whatisgiveth/codeofconduct), and [Community Communications Guide](/whatisgiveth/communityCommsGuide). It proposes the recognition and application of conflict management mechanisms to shape harmonious interactions between the members of its community.

Next Graviton Training: Begins 2nd week of April 2022

üëâüèº DM @Juan Carlos Bell Llin√°s if you are interested in joining.

The training is offered 2 times a year with the intention to form Gravitons - the team of individuals equipped with knowledge and social tooling to address and mediate emerging conflicts or any uncomfortable situations in the best way possible.


### Main Actions

* Everyone in the community can fill the Gravity [typeform](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK) _(currently utilizing the Gravity form, but plan to create a unique one for Giveth)_ or approach any of the Gravitons to request support for conflicts and any sort of uncomfortable or undesired situations.
* In case of conflict, Gravitons can approach the parties involved to collect information on the issues.
* Gravitons can take actions to [regulate unwanted behavior according to the graduated sanctions](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/scale-of-conflicts-graduated-sanction-guideline/234) _(Giveth Conflict Resolution Working Group is currently utilizing TEC Gravity‚Äôs graduated sanctions while concurrently meeting to adapt our own)._
* All community members can propose new methodologies to approach **graduated sanctions** and **mutual monitoring** as well as upgrade current ones through [Advice Process](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/tec-agreements-1/collective-agreements/advice-process) and [Forum Voting](https://forum.giveth.io/).
* Gravitons can submit conflicts or issues to the Gravity Registry, that is a database of the cases managed by Gravity.
* Conflict resolution calls and chats are closed to Gravitons and parties involved to respect privacy and vulnerability.
* The Giveth Conflict Resolution working group can facilitate safe spaces, skills up leveling workshops, and collaborate with TEC‚Äôs Gravity working group to host training and capacitate individuals to become Gravitons.
    * The Gravity training is free and open for all.
* Gravity can remove proposals from all the voting categories if they receive **flags** and/or are seen as harmful for the community based on our rules, boundaries, T&C‚Äôs, [Community Covenant](/whatisgiveth/covenant),[ Code of Conduct](/whatisgiveth/codeofconduct), and [Community Communications Guide](/whatisgiveth/communityCommsGuide).
