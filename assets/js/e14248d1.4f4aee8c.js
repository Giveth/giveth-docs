Donors will receive an email when GIVbacks rewards are ready to claim - this GIV can be harvested [here](https://giveth.io/givbacks). Please note that when you harvest GIV rewards from any part of the GIVeconomy, our token distro contract sends you all liquid GIV allocated to your address on that network. For example, when you harvest GIV rewards earned from staking LP tokens in the GIVfarm on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network), you also harvest rewards allocated to you from GIVbacks (if any) and the liquid amount from your GIVstream. This is broken down in the harvest popup that you encounter upon claim:\n\n:::info[]\nIf your GIV allocation is left unclaimed longer that 270 days and you have never claimed GIV with that address, the allocation may be returned to the Giveth DAO for future distribution\n:::\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GVpn68a.png)\n\n\n---\n## Disqualifying Factors for the GIVbacks Program\n\nOnce a GIVbacks round ends, there is a period of time granted to our team to review flagged projects and donations for the following disqualifying factors before GIV is distributed to donors. A project could have their \u2018Verified\u2019 status revoked if any of these factors are found. Donors to projects who are found with any of the following activity may also be denied GIVbacks for that round.\n\n1. **Giving/offering goods or services to donors in exchange for their donation.** A project owner cannot offer goods such as a sponsorship for a conference, Girl Scout cookie purchases or tickets for a dinner, even if the proceeds go to charity. Project owners cannot provide services like acting as a crypto exchange for their donors. They can explain how to use an exchange, but they cannot convert the money for their donors.\n2. **Circulating donations raised by other means.** Only \u201cfirst touch\u201d donations count for GIVbacks. If a project receives funding from a donor and is found to be circulating these donations within the Giveth platform to receive GIVbacks, they will be disqualified. For example, a project should not be sending fiat donations received elsewhere back to their donors and asking them to donate on Giveth with crypto.\n3. **The funds are not being used for what is expressed in the project page or submitted verification application.** Verified projects are responsible for keeping their projects up-to-date with information on how the funds are being used. If the project states explicitly that they are, for example, using the funds to develop education programs but are found to be using the funds to employ developers, they may be disqualified from the GIVbacks program.\n4. **Unscrupulous or fraudulent activity.** This can be the use of violence, breaking laws, or other behaviour that does not uphold the [values of the Giveth community](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/). Projects found to be violating our [Terms and Conditions](https://giveth.io/tos) will not only lose their verification status, but also will be canceled.\n\nThe Giveth Project Verification team is responsible for monitoring GIVbacks activity and the Project Verification system, and will ultimately use their discretion to determine whether a project\u2019s actions are unscrupulous and/or disqualifying.\n\n## Sanctions for flagged donations\n\nVerified projects and donations that are flagged for any of the disqualifying factors above will be analyzed and discerned according to the sanctions outlined here:\n\n- A donor whose GIVbacks were revoked because they were found to be recirculating funds or donated to a project that was disqualified for that round will receive an email with a link to the forum post discussing eligible donations for that round. Donations cannot be refunded and GIVbacks cannot be \u201cunrevoked\u201d if the project was disqualified from the round.\n\nDonations are donations and they go directly to the project. The GIVbacks program was created to additionally empower our donors with GIV & therefore governance rights, but you should not make a donation purely out of the expectation of receiving GIV. We appreciate your understanding.\n\n---\n\n**The GIVbacks program is our way of giving back to those who give. It\u2019s our exit to the community - empowering real donors with governance power over the future of Giveth and hence, the Future of Giving.
