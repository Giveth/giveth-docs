## Current status
The Giveth Donation Platform is currently live in *beta* stage on the Ethereum mainnet, bridged to Rinkeby testnet. You can read our most recent public updates [here](https://medium.com/giveth/tagged/dappening) and are welcome in our [chat](http://giveth.io/join) for any question! **NOTE**: We are currently in 'maintenance' mode, actively supporting existing projects on our platform but not accepting any new ones. In order to build a sustainable future for ourselves and any public good **we are building [the Commons Stack](http://commonsstack.org)**, a collaboration between [Giveth](http://giveth.io) and [BlockScience](http://block.science). We are however moving forward with the DApp in the context of its integration in the Commons Stack component library as the Giveth Proposal Engine. You can read more about this [on our medium](https://medium.com/giveth/the-future-of-giving-is-crowdfunding-the-commons-ac265e3010b8) and of course on [the Commons Stack website.](http://commonsstack.org)  

Giveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our system cuts out bureaucracy and enables makers to create a high level of transparency and accountability towards Givers. For example: At any point until the moment funds are locked, a Giver can decide to withdraw them. You can read more about the basic components and the **logic behind our DApp (Donation Application) in this [post.](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4)**

It's been a quest getting to mainnet efficiency, challenged by **scalability issues** that were too prohibitive for real use, but we found a smooth solution with a bridge. You can read **a more detailed account here: [Tackling Ethereum scalability issues (medium post)](https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060)**

We are growing our community steadily!  The Giveth Galaxy of builders is ever-expanding, and an update on **our current status** is available **[here](https://medium.com/giveth/where-are-we-now-status-of-the-giveth-dapp-5f5ba7791d12)**

Check out the charitable projects onboarded into our **live beta** and register as a user by completing a profile. You can support the development of our Dapp by giving to a DAC or Campaign, or funding specific Milestones directly to see exactly how your donation creates positive change in the world:
