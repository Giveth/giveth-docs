With GIVbacks, we\u2019re rewarding givers by giving GIV to donors to verified projects on Giveth._\\n\\n<img alt=\'what if giving gave back\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbackBanner.png\')} />\\n\\n\\nWeb3 and, specifically, Ethereum have the potential to revolutionize the philanthropic space. We have the tools to open new funding streams and create economic abundance for everyone who is providing value to society.\\n\\nClean air, clear water, bridges, roads, free childcare, public education, taking care of the less fortunate \u2014 these are all examples of public goods that, when governments fail to provide them, we look to non-profits to create and care for. For funding, we have been relying on donors to give to these non-profits and receive nothing in return. Society has been depending on and [ultimately exploiting the altruists](https://youtu.be/PFy458wCQ0g?t=504) who are working hard to protect and provide for our collective needs.\\n\\n**GIVbacks is a paradigm shift for the donation space. For the first time ever, there is an economic upside to donating.**\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksMeme1.png\')} />\\n\\nGIVbacks is the first step towards a world in which everyone benefits from creating value: **when you give to verified projects, 100% of your donation goes directly to the project, and you get** [**GIV**](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/#about-giv) **from Giveth!**\\n\\nWith over 900 verified projects on Giveth, donors can find projects that speak to their values and get rewarded for giving. Verified projects benefit from the extra traffic on Giveth & can use this program to attract new donors who are willing to support their initiatives.\\n\\n## The Big Picture\\n\\n\\nBefore we get into the fine details of exactly how the GIVbacks program works, let me walk you through the big picture that is the \u201cwhy\u201d.\\n\\n### Projects should feel good about raising funds for their project\\n\\n\\nCharity has traditionally created a dynamic where projects who do good work to benefit society have to beg for funds to make the world a better place. On the flip side, donors are being asked to sacrifice \u2014 to give without expecting anything in return.\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksMeme2.png\')} />\\n\\n\\nGIVbacks is changing that. Donors have the opportunity to support projects they believe in, get GIV in return, and start or increase their [GIVstream](https://giveth.io/givstream). They can use that GIV to grow their rewards by, for example, staking in the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm). It\u2019s a win/win: Projects benefit from receiving 100% of the donation, and donors benefit by earning GIV and becoming part of the Giveth ecosystem.\\n\\n### GIVbacks gives governance power to the donors using Giveth\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksMeme3.png\')} />\\n\\n\\nGiveth is of the donors, by the donors, and for the donors. [Our GIVdrop](https://giveth.io/claim) was sent to the Blockchain4good community \u2014 [and particularly crypto donors & Giveth users](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givdrop/) \u2014 because we wanted to kickstart the [GIVeconomy](https://giveth.io/) with value-aligned GIVers. Now, as the economy expands, we want the donors who are using the platform and giving to causes they care about to get proportionally increasing governance power. With GIVbacks, the more you give, the more GIV you get, and that GIV can be used in the [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden) to decide which proposals get funded to expand the GIVeconomy.\\n\\n### GIVbacks are like tax-deductible donations but without governments and borders\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksMeme4.png\')} />\\n\\n\\nLet\u2019s face it, tax-deductible donations can be a bit of a headache. Nonprofit projects have to cut through miles of red tape and donors have to do accounting each year, saving associated paperwork for some arbitrary number of years.\\n\\nGIVbacks provides a similar end, but cuts the bureaucracy. If a project can prove they are legitimately adding value to society, they can become a verified project in the GIVbacks program, no matter what their legal or DAO structure is. If a donor is moved by a verified project\u2019s work, they can give and receive GIV in return, no matter where (or if) they pay taxes. No need to save receipts or paperwork for fear of getting audited. Web3 makes it so that we don\u2019t need governments and taxes to make this kind of system. We can transcend borders to connect people with projects anywhere in the world!\\n\\n### GIVbacks educates community members about web3\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksMeme5.png\')} />\\n\\n\\nThe long-term vision of Giveth is to enable for-good projects to use token engineering and DAO coordination on the ground. GIVbacks is [the first step towards achieving this goal](https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1640). With GIVbacks, ordinary donors start learning about and getting curious about DAO tools like [token streams](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream), [DeFi](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givfarm) and [token-weighted voting](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givgarden). Furthermore, when donors get GIV, they are naturally inclined to donate it! In GIVbacks round 1, 75% of the total value of donations to verified projects on our platform were in GIV.\\n\\nWith the GIVbacks program, both donors and projects receive GIV and start looking into how to grow their earnings, swiftly falling down the web3 rabbit hole via [giveth.io](https://giveth.io/).\\n\\n### GIVbacks will evolve into a system that transforms successful projects into DAOs and donors into impact investors\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksMeme6.png\')} />\\n\\nGIVbacks as it is today is the first step on a path to expand Giveth into a place [where nonprofits can become microeconomies](https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1356). Next, we plan to introduce GIVcuration \u2014 a system where users can stake their GIV on projects they care about, signaling support while earning a yield. A successful project in the GIVcuration system will eventually be able to get its own GIV-collateralized [bonding curve](https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-augmented-bonding-curve-part-1-a-web3-way-to-fund-public-goods-7c9d1a871ae2), called a \u2018[Gurve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZiGlIm2vBs&t=1093s)\u2019.\\n\\nWhen donors support a project with a Gurve, their GIVbacks get split: they get some GIV, and [some GIV goes into the Gurve, minting the donor \u2018project tokens\u2019](https://youtu.be/VV7TmNILk6o?t=1356), thereby increasing the price of the project tokens.\\n\\nBefore getting a Gurve, a project will need to set up a [rewards system](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/outlining-the-rewards-system-process-v2/646) to distribute their \u2018reputation tokens\u2019 to volunteers and on-the-ground supporters. When their Gurve is initialized, those reputation tokens turn into \u2018project tokens\u2019, and the project can use token-weighted voting systems to govern their donations.\\n\\nWith Gurves, a successful project on Giveth will be able to become a sustainable DAO, governing its own economy, with its supporters as stakeholders and donors as impact investors!\\n\\n## The Fine Details\\n\\n\\nSo how exactly does this program work? Well, it makes use of a system for verifying projects on Giveth, and tracks donations to those projects in 2 week \u201crounds\u201d. Let\u2019s dig into the details.\\n\\n### Verified Projects\\n\\n\u201cVerified\u201d is a seal of approval for legitimate projects on Giveth. Many Verified projects came pre-vetted from [The Giving Block](https://twitter.com/TheGivingBlock) API. The Giving Block is an organization that supports and onboards registered 501c3s from the United States into crypto, and with our integration you can donate to their projects from the Giveth UI.\\n\\nFor non-Giving Block projects, project owners need to fill out a [typeform](https://giveth.typeform.com/verification) and answer some questions. Verified Projects need to show that they are doing work to create [non-excludable](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/market-failure-and-the-role-of-government/externalities-topic/a/public-goods-cnx) value for society and that they have some reputation at stake that would prevent them from gaming or manipulating the GIVbacks program for personal gain.\\n\\nOur amazing Project Verification Team then reviews these applications, investigates the information provided & informs the project owners about the verdict. Approved projects will have their Verified badges [at the start of the very next GIVbacks round](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#project-verification). You can learn more about the project verification process and qualifying/disqualifying factors in our [GIVbacks documentation](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks/).\\n\\n<img alt=\'verified badge\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GivethIOdonateButton.png\')} />\\n\\n\\n**Getting your project verified builds a relationship of trust with your donors by demonstrating your project\u2019s legitimacy and showing that the funds are being used to create positive change.**\\n\\n### GIVbacks Rounds\\n\\nGIVbacks rounds are 2 week periods wherein all donations to verified projects are tracked and recorded in our database. At the end of a round, our team reviews the donations and [calculates the amount of GIV to send to each donor](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#getting-givbacks). Note that recipient addresses of verified projects on Giveth do not get GIVbacks for their donations. This is to prevent recirculating funds and other fraudulent activity**_._**\\n\\nOnce the distribution has been determined, and [any suspicious activity](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#disqualifying-factors-for-givbacks-program) has been resolved, [reputation DAO token holders](https://medium.com/giveth/the-giveth-dao-community-givernance-84f55fa1ce36) vote to approve the allocation. You can see the votes to distribute GIVbacks for each round in our forum [here](https://forum.giveth.io/tag/givbacks-distro). When the vote passes, donors are notified via email that their GIVbacks are ready to claim [from the GIVbacks page](https://giveth.io/givbacks).\\n\\n<img alt=\'givbacks round example\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVbacksRoundExample.png\')} />\\n\\n**Every 2 weeks, there is 1 million GIV available to give back to donors!**\\n\\nUntil December 23, 2026 donors who get GIV from GIVbacks are able to claim some part immediately upon distribution, and some part added to their [GIVstream flowrate](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream). With the GIVstream, donors who give to verified projects on Giveth get more GIV continuously [as the GIViverse expands.](https://giveth.io/givstream)\\n\\nGIVbacks is the next generation of philanthropy where, using the power of web3, we can transform legacy systems that require those who give to sacrifice, into ones where giving actually gives back.\\n\\n### Join the revolution, [donate to a verified project today](https://giveth.io/projects)."},{"id":"welcomeGIVeconomy","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/welcomeGIVeconomy","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-24-welcomeGIVeconomy.md","title":"Welcome to the GIVeconomy","description":"It is our great pleasure to officially introduce the GIVeconomy \u2014 an economy that rewards and empowers those who give to projects, to societies, and to the world.","date":"2021-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"24 de diciembre de 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":7.92,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lauren","imageURL":"/img/laurenAuthor.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcomeGIVeconomy","title":"Welcome to the GIVeconomy","author":"Lauren","author_image_url":"/img/laurenAuthor.png","image":"/img/blog/GIVeconomyBanner.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"What if giving gave back?

We [started in 2016](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/history/) by writing the [MiniMe token](https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787) and the [Vault](https://medium.com/giveth/the-vault-contract-open-sourced-by-giveth-fe2261f7b91b) contracts, building open-source infrastructure and using it for our donation applications (DApps). Fast forward to this year, we released [giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) for [streamlined P2P giving](https://medium.com/giveth/the-future-of-giving-is-here-d480388a3338) and [Giveth TRACE](https://www.trace.giveth.io/) for [customizable fund management and traceable donations](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-trace-is-live-e91b0be1e1f6), both powered by blockchain technology. These are the building blocks that we\u2019ve been developing to realize our vision for the future. A future in which\u2026\\n\\n> _Giving is effortless and people all around the world are rewarded for creating positive change._\\n\\nToday, our dreams enter reality as we proudly announce the GIVeconomy: An economy that supports projects that create value for society and encourages on-the-ground change-makers to enter web3. An economy that empowers and rewards donors for giving. And, fundamentally, **an economy that is owned and governed by those who give.**\\n\\n\\n<img alt=\'giveconomy banner\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVeconomyBanner.png\')} />\\n\\n## The GIV Token\\n\\n\\nGIV is the governance token that fuels and directs the GIVeconomy. GIV holders are empowered to collectively coordinate around shared resources and fund initiatives that shape the Future of Giving.\\n\\n### Token Info\\n\\n\\n*   Token Address on Mainnet: 0x900db999074d9277c5da2a43f252d74366230da0\\n*   Token Address on xDai: 0x4f4F9b8D5B4d0Dc10506e5551B0513B61fD59e75\\n\\n### Distribution\\n\\n\\nAt inception, the GIVeconomy has an initial circulating supply of 17.05 million GIV which is available to claim by the Giveth \u201ctrusted seed\u201d in the GIVdrop. The distribution of all GIV across the GIViverse is as follows:\\n\\n<img alt=\'GIVdrop distribution\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/tokenDistribution.png\')} />\\n\\nPast contributors, crypto donors & Giveth users make up 17.05% of the GIViverse. We\u2019ve allocated 26.95% of GIV to future contributors, the [rGIV DAO treasury](https://medium.com/giveth/the-giveth-dao-community-givernance-84f55fa1ce36) & future roadmap projects (described at the end of this post) as part of our [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/). The rest is fueling our GIVeconomy pillars:\\n\\n*   33% allocated to the [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden) common pool to fund proposals governed by GIV holders with [conviction voting](https://forum.giveth.io/t/conviction-voting/154).\\n*   13% allocated to reward donors to verified projects with GIV from our [GIVbacks](https://giveth.io/givbacks) program.\\n*   10% allocated to reward liquidity providers and stakers in the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm).\\n\\n## The GIVdrop\\n\\n\\nTo initialize a DAO led by Givers, we have created the [GIVdrop](https://giveth.io/claim). With the GIVdrop, 17.05% of the initial supply has been distributed to the Giveth trusted seed \u2014 crypto philanthropists, Giveth users & contributors, and [Blockchain4good](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blockchain4good&src=typed_query) heroes. These are value-aligned individuals that have been working, directly or indirectly, to further [Giveth\u2019s mission](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/), and now are being brought into an ecosystem of collective support, abundance and value-creation. With no VCs or presales, **the GIVeconomy is kicked off by the donors, of the donors and for the donors.**\\n\\nTo read more about the GIVdrop and eligibility, [check out our documentation](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givdrop) or [see if you qualify](https://giveth.io/claim).\\n\\n## The GIVstream\\n\\n\\n[The GIVstream](https://giveth.io/givstream) provides a continuous flow of GIV to GIVeconomy participants. We call it _the expanding GIViverse_. The GIVeconomy begins humbly but as time passes, the GIViverse expands and GIV is streamed out to our community of GIVers. **In this way, as the GIVeconomy grows & stabilizes, we empower those who support the Giveth ecosystem with increasing governance rights.**\\n\\n<img alt=\'GIVstream expansion\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIViverseExpansion.gif\')} />\\n\\n###### h/t [@RodriCastillo](https://twitter.com/_rodricast) for the awesome GIF\\n\\nThose who receive the GIVdrop also receive a GIVstream. Anyone can increase their GIV/week flowrate by participating in the GIVeconomy through [GIVbacks](https://giveth.io/givbacks), the [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden) or the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm). To learn more, [check out our documentation](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream) or [see your GIVstream flowing](https://giveth.io/givstream).\\n\\n## GIVeconomy Starting Line\\n\\nWe\u2019re launching the GIVeconomy with three key pillars \u2014 GIVbacks, the GIVfarm, and the GIVgarden.\\n\\n### GIVbacks\\n\\n<img alt=\'GIVbacks meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVeconomyMeme1.png\')} />\\n\\n###### h/t to [@griff](https://twitter.com/thegrifft) & our #Meme channel in [Discord](https://discord.giveth.io/)\\n\\n**GIVbacks is a paradigm shift for the donation space. Instead of** [**relying on sacrifice to drive value creation**](https://youtu.be/PFy458wCQ0g?t=504)**, we are _rewarding_ the givers.** With GIVbacks, 1 million GIV is available to give to donors to verified projects on Giveth every 2 weeks!\\n\\nThe GIVbacks program has multiple advantages:\\n\\n*   It attracts donors \u2014 and therefore great projects \u2014 to Giveth.\\n*   It ensures the quality of projects on Giveth using our [Project Verification](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks#project-verification) system.\\n*   It \u201cgives back\u201d to donors for supporting on-the-ground teams adding value to society.\\n*   **It gives donors governance rights so they can direct the Future of Giving.**\\n\\nThanks to our verification team and our recent integration with [The Giving Block](https://twitter.com/TheGivingBlock), Givers have over 700 fully-vetted projects to choose from! To learn more about GIVbacks, [check out our documentation](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks)**.**\\n\\n### GIVgarden\\n\\n<img alt=\'giveconomy banner\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVeconomyMeme2.png\')} />\\n\\n###### h/t [@mateodaza](https://twitter.com/mateodazab) & our #memes channel in [Discord](https://discord.giveth.io/)\\n\\nThe [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden) is the decentralized governance platform for Giveth and the GIVeconomy. [Powered by 1hive](https://gardens.1hive.org/), the GIVgarden is where GIV holders can make and vote on proposals to fund value-aligned initiatives that shape the Future of Giving. It has four main components:\\n\\n1.  [Conviction Voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475) for fund management\\n2.  [Tao Voting](https://forum.giveth.io/t/tao-voting-explained/155) for executing on-chain decisions\\n3.  [Our Covenant](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/covenant/) that outlines standards for on-chain and off-chain community behaviour, and\\n4.  [Celeste](https://1hive.gitbook.io/celeste/) as a decentralized court to settle disputes.\\n\\nTo learn more about the GIVgarden, [check out our documentation](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givgarden)**.**\\n\\n### GIVfarm\\n\\n<img alt=\'givfarm homepage\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVfarm.png\')} />\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*GHRbTc7_MidaoMI9)\\n\\nFor the GIVeconomy to function, GIV must be easy to acquire. The [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm) is the place to grow and harvest rewards while supporting the GIVeconomy by providing liquidity for GIV! We have farming opportunities on Ethereum Mainnet (ETH) and xDai Network (Gnosis chain), and 35 million GIV are allocated to the rewards program for the first 6 months. A further 65 million GIV has been allocated to provide future farming opportunities. Farms are LIVE now and rewards are BOUNTIFUL! \ud83c\udf3e [Check it out here](https://giveth.io/givfarm) or  [read more in our documentation.](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givfarm) h/t to our partners at [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/) and [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) for supporting GIVfarm development!\\n\\n## Future Plans\\n\\n\\nThe launch of GIV and everything above is only the beginning for the GIVeconomy \u2014 we\u2019re already crafting the next phase in the Future of Giving. We\u2019re developing systems that completely change the way societies create and reward the creation of public goods.\\n\\n<img alt=\'future plans meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVeconomyMeme3.png\')} />\\n\\n###### h/t [@karmaticacid](https://twitter.com/karmaticacid) & our #memes channel in [Discord](https://discord.giveth.io/)\\n\\nWe\u2019ve pre-allocated 80 million GIV to fund the development of the following projects. These ideas are raw, exciting, and beautiful and we are heaven-bent on bringing them to fruition! Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what we\u2019re planning next.\\n\\n### GIVcuration\\n\\n\\nGIVcuration will decentralize GIVbacks! Community members will be able to signal support by staking GIV on projects, and their signal will grow like in [Conviction Voting](https://forum.giveth.io/t/conviction-voting/154). In GIVbacks rounds, donors who give to community-favoured projects will get more GIVbacks, and GIVcurators will earn rewards on their staked GIV.\\n\\n### GIVmatching\\n\\n\\nWe plan to implement a donation matching system for projects on Giveth using _Causes_. Donors will be able to donate to Cause categories \u2014 like environmental regeneration or open-source software \u2014 and the funds collected will then be distributed to projects using [quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000), h/t to our friends at [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/).\\n\\n### GIVfi\\n\\nThe intention with GIVfi is to create a sustainable way of maintaining funds in the GIVgarden common pool. While donations on the DApp are waiting to be disbursed, they will be generating interest that can be used to buy GIV on the open market and send it to the GIVgarden for funding initiatives using Conviction Voting.\\n\\n### GURVES\\n\\n\\nThis is the real dream! We want projects on Giveth to evolve into their own microeconomies, and for the platform to become a place for crypto impact investment. This is _GURVES_ ([working title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZiGlIm2vBs&t=1093s)) \u2014 GIV token holders who stake GIV on a project will eventually be able to \u201copt-in\u201d to initialize a GIV-backed [bonding curve](https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-augmented-bonding-curve-part-1-a-web3-way-to-fund-public-goods-7c9d1a871ae2) for that project.\\n\\n<img alt=\'gurves meme\' src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/GIVeconomyMeme4.jpg\')} />\\n\\n###### h/t [**@karmaticacid**](https://twitter.com/karmaticacid) **& our #memes channel in** [**Discord**](https://discord.giveth.io/)\\n\\nWith GURVES, the GIVbacks program will transform! Whenever donors donate to a GURVE project, they will get GIVbacks and some of that GIV will go into the GURVE to mint them \u201cproject tokens\u201d & in effect, raise the price of the project token. This way, non-profits who advance in the Giveth ecosystem earn **their own economic systems that will turn donors into investors and volunteers into shareholders.**\\n\\nBut wait, there\u2019s more\u2026\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe core team at Giveth is committed to executing the above roadmap, but this is a DAO and we aren\u2019t alone in steering the ship! 33% of the token supply has been allocated to the [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden) common pool to fund the proposals that the Giveth community believe in.\\n\\nGiveth has been in the crypto donation scene [since 2016](https://twitter.com/Givethio/status/1454084287184130049). We rescued 210 million dollars from the [Parity multisig attack](https://mashable.com/article/ethereum-stolen-white-hat-group-rescued#ZPTC98wSEPOp), we ran the first [scaling-focused Ethereum conference](https://medium.com/giveth/scalingnow-summit-transcript-ea5373be8523), we created fee-free donation applications, we implemented smooth on-ramps for nonprofits to enter the crypto scene, and that was all solely funded by donations.\\n\\nThe launch of the GIVeconomy is a huge milestone but still just one more step towards building a Future of Giving that we can all be proud of. A future where value-creation for society is rewarded, where altruism becomes profitable, where communities of value-aligned supporters grow and prosper. A future in which we regenerate the earth, we build meaningful connections with each other, we revolutionize economic systems, evolve human coordination and we create societies based on decentralization, freedom, community and **love**.\\n\\n[**Welcome to the GIVeconomy**](https://giveth.io/)\\n-------------------------------------------------------"},{"id":"givethDAO","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/givethDAO","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-06-givethDAO.md","title":"The Giveth DAO: Community GIVernance","description":"Giveth has a long history of experimentation in the decentralized governance realms.","date":"2021-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"6 de diciembre de 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":11.99,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dani","imageURL":"/img/blog/DaniAuthor.jpg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"givethDAO","title":"The Giveth DAO: Community GIVernance","author":"Dani","author_image_url":"/img/blog/DaniAuthor.jpg","image":"/img/blog/givethDAOblog.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to the GIVeconomy","permalink":"/es/blog/welcomeGIVeconomy"},"nextItem":{"title":"Community Project Spotlight #4","permalink":"/es/blog/communitySpotlight4"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\'\\nimport styles from \'../src/css/custom.css\'\\n\\n\\n\\nGiveth has a long [history of experimentation](https://medium.com/giveth/the-unicorndac-a-non-hierarchical-decentralized-governance-experiment-8dfbe6e98d19) in the decentralized governance realms.\\n\\nBefore becoming a [DAO](https://xdai.aragon.blossom.software/#/nrgiv/0x749cccd03c00110cf76f4e009c6eaf59b5f2bd0e/) (with a [DAF](https://www.sdgimpactfund.org/giveth-foundation)), Giveth fund allocation was administered by a [Unicorn DAC](https://trace.giveth.io/community/unicorn-dac) \u2014 A Decentralized Altruistic Community \u2014 trying out new ways of governing the build and use of our DApp (Donation Application).\\n\\n<img alt=\\"rGIV Trace Header\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOtraceHeader.png\')} />  \\n\\nDecisions for how to distribute incoming donations to the Giveth DAC across our platform were made by nominated and approved team members, who met regularly to evaluate Traces (formerly Milestones).

We\u2019ve learned a lot along the way and are excited to share where the Giveth Reputation DAO (rGIV DAO) is now.\\n\\n## How does Giveth DAO it?\\n\\nWithin Giveth, we strive to demonstrate these principles:\\n\\n*   To value transparent, holistic governance and work to be a shining example of it.\\n*   To explore and readily adopt new innovations that support us in embodying these values.\\n*   To practice the self-organizing power of sociocracy, which we apply in the organization of tasks, participation in the [Proposal and Advice Process](../whatisgiveth/adviceProcess/), and facilitation of our governance meetings.\\n\\nOur [GIVernance Circle](../whatisgiveth/introGIVernance) Mission Statement reflects this foundational intention:\\n\\n> We **_are progressively decentralizing the Giveth decision-making process by building a community and a token-based economy around our platform that recognizes contributions, values participation and rewards altruism._**\\n\\nThe Giveth DAO is made up of [people](https://giveth.io/about) who have acquired reputation and trust through perseverance and dedication to the Future of Giving by participating in building the Giveth community and our Donation Applications (DApps).\\n\\n## nrGIV \u2014 The Reputation Token for Stewarding the GIV launch\\n\\n<img alt=\\"the nrGIV DAO\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOnrGIVvoting.png\')} />  \\n\\nMinting the new reputation tokens (nrGIV) to replace the old (rGIV) on Aragon.\\n\\nWhile most activities take place off-chain in our [publicly accessible forums](https://forum.giveth.io) and [live-streamed meetings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdqmP4axeI1hNmX20aZsOwg), the community has implemented and recently renovated an on-chain solution. Deployed via [1Hive](http://1hive.org) as an Aragon Reputation DAO using the [xDai chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/getting-started-with-xdai), it is designed to evolve along with the advancements of our own protocols as well as those of Ethereum collaborators and eventually, multi-chain ecosystems.\\n\\nIt has 3 primary stewardship responsibilities:\\n\\n1.  Stewarding the existing Giveth commons ([Giveth Multisigs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q_5VFt9C3pX-A5V0UYRSefoNPHfn3GDvEywXGvdj7cw/edit#gid=1931334782), [Giveth.io](http://giveth.io), [Trace.giveth.io](http://trace.giveth.io), and soon to launch GIVeconomy DApps)\\n2.  Stewarding the GIV token initial distribution.\\n3.  Stewarding the [Progressive Decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) of the GIVeconomy.\\n\\n## Why participate?\\n\\nReputation is earned over time, but rewards are dished early and often to recognize value and encourage participation in the Giveth Community.\\n\\nWe [!praise](../whatisgiveth/introDiscord#praisebot) you for:\\n\\n*   Attending meetings and speaking up in Discord\\n*   Testing and using our tools\\n*   Feedback into development for improvement\\n*   Maintenance of our living processes\\n*   Writing and reviewing documentation\\n*   Talking about us on social media (criticism welcome, just be kind about it!)\\n\\nMonthly tabulation of [Praise](https://trace.giveth.io/campaign/rewarddao) and [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) results in the disbursement of ETH, DAI, and/or PAN tokens, depending on what\u2019s been donated to Giveth. We give what we\u2019ve got, and the more you give, the more you get!\\n\\nOver time, new contributors can build reputation in the community and become eligible for nrGIV tokens that are minted on a quarterly basis. **In this way we co-create a community of builders that are self-organized by design, decentralized by technology, and altruistic by nature.**\\n\\n## Who Qualifies? It Starts with Showing Up!\\n\\n\\n**Anyone can earn rewards by engaging in the Giveth community**\\n\\nPraise is our way of saying thanks for being awesome. The first 20 minutes of our [weekly Community Call](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MW5zazNraGxzbmZza3EzcDJlYmpnaWd1YjYgZ2l2ZXRoZG90aW9AbQ&tmsrc=givethdotio%40gmail.com) are dedicated to celebrating who did what for the past week. By using the PraiseBot, !praise can be given in any channel on the Giveth Discord server at any time, and we even have a dedicated [#praise channel](https://discord.giveth.io) because there are so many people doing great things.\\n\\nAll those **_thank you_**\u2019s are captured in a spreadsheet and reviewed by the Working Group Stewards every four weeks, to use in combination with SourceCred for allocating a percentage of the available Rewards to contributors. This practice of !praising contributors transparently and distributing rewards was kicked off 4 years ago with the [first PraiseBot built for Giveth](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-bot) on Matrix and now carried forward by [Commons Stack](http://commonsstack.org) and the [Token Engineering Commons](http://tecommons.org)!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Giveth.io join page\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOjoinPage.png\')} />  \\n\\n\\n**Givething Cred for contributions through Discord, Discourse, & GitHub**\\n\\nAs a global digital community, we recognize that while much of what we do is seen by others \u2014 a lot is also just happening organically online and can be quantified to some extent by using data analytics.\\n\\nWhen you engage in our community discussions on Discord, participate in the soft governance via our Discourse forums, and create or work on issues in the GitHub repositories, these interactions are recorded and gathered into a [SourceCred dashboard](https://cred.giveth.io/#/explorer).\\n\\n**Consistency builds Reputation, and earns Trust**\\n\\nContributors qualify for nrGIV (Giveth Reputation Tokens) after 3 months of participation as recorded via the Praise and SourceCred calculations reviewed monthly. These tokens are minted quarterly for new and active contributors. Those no longer contributing do not receive more nrGIV \u2014 but do retain all of the tokens previously received.\\n\\n## When did Giveth move to On-chain Governance?\\n\\n> The original rGIV DAO instance can be seen [here](https://aragon.1hive.org/#/giveth/0x8ce560c4e8ddc2f735044140e677cc936a68dd6a/), where we launched with 1,111 tokens distributed to each of the 8 Giveth Reputation DAO co-founders in January 2021 for the previous year.\\n\\n<img id=\\"resize50\\" alt=\\"current contributor spreadsheet\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOcurrentContributors.png\')} />  \\n\\n2,222 tokens were minted for each qualifying contributor in April for January-March 2021, then [3,333 in July](https://forum.giveth.io/t/passed-rgiv-token-distro-q2-contributors/52) for April-June. As in any good experiment, discoveries arose from these iterations and in October 2021, the rGIV DAO voted to retire the rGIV token in favor of creating a new instance (nrGIV) with several configuration changes, including the move from 1,111 to 1, ditching the extra digits.\\n\\n**_Also changed in this new rGIV DAO: the distribution of tokens now follows a Fibonacci sequence. This means that the number of tokens minted for each contributor in the latest period is equal to the sum of the two previous two periods._**\\n\\nAs shown, [Dani](https://twitter.com/TheOfficeMystic) has been contributing since day 1. She earned 1 token to vote with the first period (1,111 \u2014 which was converted to 1 in the new simplified DAO), 2 tokens for the second period, 3 tokens the third period (because 1 + 2 = 3), and 5 tokens the fourth period (because 2 + 3 = 5). If she stops contributing there, she will retain her total balance of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11 nrGiv tokens for voting on governance proposals after the 4th period. If she continues consistently contributing to the Giveth Community, she will always have at least 1 token more than any contributors that came in later.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"the nrGIV DAO token holders\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOtokenHolders.png\')} />  \\n\\n[James](https://twitter.com/positonic) is a co-founder of the rGIV DAO, and received tokens for periods 1, 2, and 3. He resigned during the 3rd period to focus on [toucan.earth](https://toucan.earth/), and did not contribute during the 4th period, so does not qualify for the minting of 5 tokens. His voting weight remains at 6 tokens, while current contributors weight grows to 11. In this case where a past contributor does not return for 6 months and misses 2 full periods, their voting weight is now lower than a new contributor receiving nrGIV tokens during those two mintings.\\n\\nSo in this example, new contributors in periods 4 and 5 receive 8 tokens (3 + 5) bringing their total to 12 (5 + 8) \u2014 double that of James. When James returns, he will come in with his previous token weight and after another 3 months of contributions, qualifies to again receive nrGIV tokens.\\n\\nIn this way new contributors can gain as much influence as someone who has contributed in the prior two time periods, and over time the influence of past contributors is reduced after exiting the community. Behind this design is an assumption that those currently contributing can make the most informed vote about current governance of the organization. For consistent contributors who have been around from the beginning, those joining later will never reach or surpass your voting power, incentivizing retention of talent and wisdom for the community while incrementally fractionalizing the lead.\\n\\n> Successful decentralized governance has been shown to require a healthy balance of new contributors being valued early, and long-time contributors valued for carrying the vital threads of vision, mission and information on the organization from past experience.\\n\\nNote: If you are on maternity or paternity leave, you still get the period\u2019s token allocations during leave.\\n\\n## What is the nrGIV token used for?\\n\\n**Voting on proposals that build the #FutureofGiving**\\n\\nAnyone can make a proposal to the rGIV DAO, whether they are an nrGIV token holder or not. But first! Giveth follows a Sociocratic proposal-forming process by soliciting opinions and clarifying questions initially, then making revisions and polling for support via an Advice Process on our forum.\\n\\n> **Previously hosted on** [**Loomio**](https://www.loomio.com/)**, you can see the proposal process** [**used to initiate the rGIV DAO**](https://www.loomio.org/d/4TKQjvCg/configuring-giveth-dao-rep-token-on-aragon-1hive) **here!**\\n\\nIn 2021 Giveth revised its organizational structure into new Circles and Working Groups while launching a [new proposal management method on Discourse](https://forum.giveth.io/):\\n\\n<img alt=\\"the giveth forum\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOforum.png\')} />  \\n\\n## From Off-chain Advice to On-chain Voting\\n\\nAfter a proposal has been reviewed, the champion (person writing and advocating for the proposal) can post a new Vote to the rGIV DAO! Once made, nrGIV token holders have 5 days to use their tokens and vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Voting on each proposal in this DAO allocates your fully accrued nrGIV token quantity; and you do not lose them if you vote. In other words, if you have 7 tokens, and you vote \u201cyes,\u201d then 7 nrGIV tokens are added to the total \u201cyes\u201d votes while the tokens remain in your wallet. When you vote on other proposals, you still have 7 nrGIV tokens to vote on those as well.\\n\\n> **The Giveth Reputation DAO does not use Conviction Voting or require you to \u201cstake\u201d your reputation tokens \u2014 you never lose your tokens or have to choose which proposal to use them on; you always have the same number of tokens to vote with for each new proposal.**\\n\\nIn order for a proposal to pass, it must have a majority of yes votes, and reach a \u201cminimum approval\u201d level, which we\u2019ve set at 25%. If a proposal doesn\u2019t have more than 25% of all minted tokens voting yes on it, it automatically does not pass regardless of the distribution of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d votes given. However, the proposal can always be proposed again and voted on again.\\n\\nThe second metric within each vote is the \u201cSupport\u201d level. We have set that at 88%. If a vote reaches this level, it has more than the majority by a large margin and is labeled as having strong support. The third metric set by the DAO is \u201cvote duration\u201d; how much time must pass before voting is closed.\\n\\nWhich Decisions Does the Giveth Reputation DAO Need to Vote on?\\n===============================================================\\n\\nThe rGIV DAO has the responsibility for governing the GIVeconomy launch and our commons. This means that the assets built by the Giveth community and the funding received from donors to support Giveth are owned by the Community itself \u2014 the Givers and Makers contributing their skills, time, energy and resources to it. So deciding how to build the DApps, contract with individuals to fill roles on the team, and distribute funds to the Circles for maintaining operations and development of the open source code is a job for nrGIV token holders that collectively make up the rGIV DAO.\\n\\nThe road to decentralized governance has been paved with the bricks of this goodwill, and you can see again in Loomio how the Giveth Unicorn DAC used the Advice Process and voting to decide how to [allocate a 285 ETH gift in 2019](https://www.loomio.org/d/Sbn1FeT7/285-eth-what-am-i-gonna-do-)!\\n\\nThe Giveth Reputation DAO has the opportunity to do this again now as we contemplate allocation of the proceeds from [Rainbow Rolls](https://medium.com/rainbow-rollup/nftps-rainbow-rolls-7a01d5eb1bb2) and the [Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Grant](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retropgf-experiment-1-1-million-dollars-for-public-goods-f7e455cbdca). Balancing the upcoming needs of the Community to sustain itself through launching the GIVeconomy this year, and to reward the contributors who worked tirelessly in past years to earn the respect and the funding, is the responsibility of the current DAO members.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"rainbow rollup donation\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOrainbowRoll.png\')} />  \\n\\nIf this is a subject that interests you enough to have read this whole post, perhaps you are interested in contributing to the Giveth commons by participating in our off-chain Advice Process on the current decision regarding [how to allocate the funds from Rainbow Rolls](https://forum.giveth.io/t/what-to-do-with-the-eth-from-rainbow-rolls/173)!\\n\\nWe are a donor-focused organization and in order to build what meets the needs of our donors AND project owners, we welcome and encourage your donations AND your suggestions.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"spice girls - tell me what you want\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/rgivDAOmeme1.jpeg\')} />  \\n\\n## Giveth DAOs Donations\\n\\n\\nGiveth is run entirely on donations, which can be given through a variety of routes including the [DAC on TRACE](https://trace.giveth.io/community/giveth-dac), the [Project at Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/the-giveth-community-of-makers), [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/795/givethio-panvala-league), and direct contributions to the MultiSig wallet address.

Untangling our relationship, as humans, with plastic will be one of the great challenges of our time. UPF Coin is a project by Unplastify which, as the name implies, is on a mission to put the brakes on our consumption of plastic. Unplastify is based out of Argentina and the USA, and provides a wide range of educational and practical activities promoting unplastification.\\n\\nTheir primary area of interest is the crippling effects of plastic waste in our oceans. To that end in 2018 they embarked on an epic oceanic adventure where the team took off on a sailboat named \u201cFanky\u201d across the Atlantic and back, collecting plastic samples and researching impacts and alternatives to plastic. Their voyage took them from the ports of New York City all the way to Corsica and back across the pond to Buenos Aires, Argentina. You can check out more of the work unplastify does on [their website](https://www.unplastify.com/).\\n\\nThe UPF Coin project introduces the powerful realities of blockchain and tokenization to their noble cause. At the heart of this lies a proprietary UPF blockchain which operates on a \u201cproof of unplastify work\u201d to distribute UPF coins. Every coin minted represents one tonne of avoided plastic consumption. Unplastification work done will be human validated by the UPF team. They plan to have a working blockchain and 25 UPF coins emitted by the end of this quarter! That\u2019s 25 tonnes of plastic mitigated. Donations to their project will help them research and fund the deployment of the UPF token economy. [Check out UPF Coin on giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/upf-coin) and make a donation!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Positive Blockchain\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/positiveBlockchain.png\')} />\\n\\n## Positive Blockchain\\n\\nWith an ever-increasing emergence of \u2018blockchain-for-good\u2019 projects, how can anyone keep up with all these amazing high vibes? Positive Blockchain is building the data-driven solution, having created the database for the blockchain-for-good universe. They maintain an impressive library of philanthropic blockchain project profiles that allow anyone to find projects working on causes they care about.\\n\\nPositive Blockchain keeps track of the status of each project, whether they are in conception, began development or have already launched. From their [Impact Dashboard](https://pb.chainist.de/) you can make a wide range of queries and see statistics of what projects are working on. They use the [UN\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) as part of the base metrics for querying projects. From the Social Impact Map you can see the distribution of blockchain-for-good projects worldwide.\\n\\nThey are asking for donations to expand their network of partners, maintain their databases and source out professional assistance in their tasks. If an excessive amount of funds are raised they will put them to expanding their network of projects in Africa. Visit the [Positive Blockchain website](https://positiveblockchain.io/) and check out [their project on giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/positiveblockchain.io) to make a donation!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"CineFi Network\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/cineFiNetwork.png\')} />\\n\\n## CineFi Network\\n\\n_Coming soon to a blockchain near you! \u2026_\\n\\nThe decentralization of the film industry stands to be a great boon for artists, producers, actors and viewers alike. The game-changing dynamics of blockchain are pervasive across an expansive list of modern industries. CineFi is introducing a platform to revolutionize funding and revenue streams from film-making.\\n\\nThe CineFi Network begins with artists submitting proposals for films they\u2019re inspired to create. A CineFi token (CINE) will be the medium through which users can interact with proposals and films. Platform users can decide whether or not to invest funds (CINE) into bringing the film proposals into fruition. If the film reaches its funding goal a fractilized NFT is generated which represents proportional rights to creators and investors of the film, guaranteeing a cut of the revenues generated. The platform also allows users to stream or purchase these decentrally financed films with the same CINE tokens.\\n\\nBy this novel system, CineFi effectively allows for real-time community signalling for what films they want to see made. Thanks to Blockchain technology, creators and artists can more transparently navigate the terms on which they share revenues generated from their works. The blockchain becomes the final source of truth for where the fractalized NFTs are distributed, where funding comes from and where revenues go.\\n\\nAccording to the [CineFi website](https://cinefi.network/) we can hope to see film proposals rolling in by around mid-2022. Checkout [CineFi Network on giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/cinefi) to make a donation!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Good Work Foundation\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/goodWorkFoundation.png\')} />\\n\\n## Good Work Foundation\\n\\nAccess to modern education programmes in rural communities has always proved to be challenging; resources, budgeting and infrastructure all play a role. In Africa, these challenges create troubling disparities between populations. The Good Work Foundation (GWF) is focused on closing this gap and raising the bar. They have created a wide range of educational programmes with a focus on digital literacy. The programmes offered go from primary school students all the way to post-secondary specialized training for adults.\\n\\nOn Giveth, GWF is raising funds particularly for their Open Learning Academy programme, which focuses on young students in rural South Africa. On the project page they mention the staggering statistics they\u2019re grappling with:\\n\\n_\u201cIn_ **_rural South Africa_**_, of 100 South African children that start school, approximately 60 will reach and write matric (high-school graduation exam), 37 will pass, and 12 will access university. This crippling problem will be even more exacerbated going into 2022.\u201d_\\n\\nThe programme intends to reach over 9,000 students from grade 4 to 8 in the municipality of Bushbuckridge in South Africa. The Open Learning Academy allows rural schools to outsource coding, robotics and digital literacy programmes to the GWF learning centre. The programme intends to support existing curriculums, rather than diverge from them, allowing participating children to build relevant skills to continue their education. You can learn more about GWF and their other programmes on [their website](https://www.goodworkfoundation.org/). Be sure to check out [their project on giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/gwf-giving-tuesday-2021) and make a donation to support rural African education!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Co-funding the DAOist\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/cofundingDAOist.gif\')} />\\n\\n## Co-funding the DAOist\\n\\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), as a concept, is reforging the archaic methods of how we organize and govern as humans. DAOs represent not just a technological blockchain breakthrough, but also a cultural force to be reckoned with. DAOs in effect allow organizations to form organically and continually evolve, leaning on blockchain transparency and computer-aided governance systems. The technology we use to create DAOs is constantly iterating upon itself however we as humans remain as the constant base layer, \u201c**_Layer 0_**\u201d.\\n\\nThe DAOist is a DAO (aptly so) that intends to capture this social phenomenon and to incubate resulting ideas, collaboration and cultural practices. This takes form as live and virtual events held around existing events in the Ethereum community. They host conferences where DAO champions can come and share experience and knowledge and to build partnerships with other value-aligned communities.\\n\\nTheir first event was in [Paris for EthCC4 in July of 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBV5All5yM8). It was a huge success and the people demanded more, so they [hosted a second one in Lisbon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5aUHWDU7jg), in October, of the same year. Their instant success has only proven that there\u2019s a real desire to open up a space for DAOs to share and learn. To that end, they want to create educational spaces, physical and virtual, to empower DAOs. They are also in the process of defining their DAO structure. The DAOist is seeking funds in order to continue to host events and to create a year-round space for DAO enthusiasts to meet, collaborate and learn.

Discover some of the magic on [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) with these projects that are making waves in our physical and digital worlds. Let\u2019s dive in!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Futuro Nativo\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/futuroNativo.png\')} />\\n\\n\\n## FUTURO NATIVO\\n\\nis celebrating and spreading indigenous cultures and practices found in the western Brazilian region of Acre. They are creating donation pathways to empower several native tribes, and are propagating holistic practices to restore our connection with the Earth. They currently support four tribal villages in the region:\\n\\n*   **Yawanawa \u2014 Shukuvena** (\u201cToucan\u201d in the local language) \u2014 Praised for fostering strong female leaders, this tribe is focused on agroforestry, food sovereignty, natural medicines and spiritual practices.\\n*   **Huni Kui \u2014 Pinuya** (\u201cHummingbird\u201d in the local language) \u2014 Residing in the northern zone of Acre, the village of Pinuya is making huge leaps in reforestation efforts and crop laying. They are focused on yielding saplings and food surpluses with the intention to move away from tourism and find alternative income sources.\\n*   **Huni Kui \u2014 Caucho** \u2014 Dwelling in the basins of the rivers Juru\xe0 and Purus, the village of Caucho strives to reclaim their culture from the shocks of colonial industrialization. The Amazon Rubber Boom eroded much of their ancestral culture. They believe in sowing their culture through music, dance and art.\\n*   **Kuntanawa** or \u201cCoconut People\u201d \u2014 Believe that plants are the way to connect with the spirits of the forest. They have mastered how to cure their people with traditional medicines and plan to cure the world by creating alliances of communities committed to restore the balance of nature.\\n\\nEach tribe boasts dozens of families living on their ancestral land, which collectively is spread out over hundreds of thousands of hectares of Amazonian rainforest. These peoples steward their land, implementing traditional agroforestry techniques, as well as ply their artisanal craft-making skills. The tribes affiliated with Futuro Nativo also host visitors and workshops to teach their culture to the curious and passionate.\\n\\nFuturo Nativo has very well defined funding goals which complement each tribe\u2019s unique needs and offerings. Visiting [their website](https://www.futuronativo.org/projects), you can see projects range from tree nurseries, educational events, to even creating online stores to distribute their artisanal crafts.

The Handshake Development (HNS) Fund is the community funding the Handshake protocol and affiliated systems. HNS at its core is a system for distributing internet domain names using cryptocurrency technology. The HNS protocol website hits home the need for better domain name distribution framework:\\n\\n> _\u201cNames on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. . . . Services on the internet have become more centralized beginning in the 1990s, but do not fulfill the original decentralized vision of the internet. . . . Centralization exists because there is a need to manage spam, griefing, and sockpuppet/sybil attacks. Previous decentralized systems largely stopped working due to spam. If it were more costly to grief on the internet using decentralized systems, the need for trusted centralized corporations to manage these risks decrease.\u201d_\\n\\nHNS uses a token (aptly named HNS) to register domain names. Using these cryptographic tokens, participants can transfer and update their registered names. By creating a decentralized and accountable system, HNS (by way of its users) can inhibit a centralized actor from scooping up all the domain names. The HNS Fund seeks out donations to keep afloat their open-source tools, such as DNS records, domain registries, and educational content. [Find their project on Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/handshake-development-fund) and make a donation to support HNS public goods!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Njome Innovation Academy\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/NjombeIA.png\')} />\\n\\n## Njombe Innovation Academy\\n\\nis creating the next generation of African entrepreneurs in Njombe, Tanzania. Njombe Innovation Academy (NIA) is importing the Social Innovation Academy (SINA) educational model which began in Uganda. The premise of SINA is to invite members of marginalized african demographics with passion and ideas to a co-living experience to gain the entrepreneurial skills to make their dreams a reality. SINA has proven to be extremely successful, tackling prevailing African issues around failing education systems and corresponding unemployment rates. Njombe Innovation Academy profoundly lays out their **Theory for Change**:\\n\\n> _\u201cThe desired impact (of NIA) is an increased number of social challenges tackled in Njombe by youth-led enterprises with locally available resources. . . . we will bootstrap a self-organised community of youth in Njombe who commonly owns(sic) and manages(sic) resources (material, knowledge, financial, social) to create social enterprises out of challenges . . . \u201c_\\n\\nSINA communities have been spreading around the continent and Uganda is ready, more than ever, for it\u2019s own local SINA node. NIA identifies that local youth unemployment hovers around 10% with more than 40% never completing secondary school. Crippling rates of malnutrition and HIV hamper the societal and economic growth of Njombe.\\n\\nNjombe Innovation Academy has outlined a clear plan for kick-starting the local SINA community. The first step is to send 3 local youth from Njombe to Uganda to gain insight from the original SINA. Then, with supporting members and facilities, these successful graduates begin to train subsequent cohorts of entrepreneurs. In 2 years they are targeting to put over 50 youth through the local Njombe SINA program and generate nearly a dozen new enterprises as a result. 50% of these participants will be women and a further 15% will be people with disabilities. All participants will come from poverty based backgrounds.\\n\\nTo learn more of NIA milestones, their funding targets and to make a donation, visit [their project on Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/Njombe-Innovation-Academy-1). NIA is also partnered with Giveth in Panvala\u2019s Regenerative Commons Coalition, you can view [their Panvala listing here](https://panvala.com/njombe-innovation-academy).\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Meme Manifesto\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/memeManifesto.png\')} />\\n\\nMeme Manifesto\\n==============\\n\\nThe 21st century cultural phenomenon of memes has embedded itself firmly in the history of humankind. Meme Manifesto goes deep\u2026 deep, down the rabbit hole of memes as an ideological force and as a new medium of communicating complex, nuanced concepts. The project conveys itself as an amorphous transmedia project that will take various forms at various points of its evolution. The Manifesto itself expresses powerful reflections on meme culture:\\n\\n> _\u201c. . . we believe memes to be the latest iteration of the one true power that defines us as a species: the faculty to understand, interpret and alter our reality through linguistic and symbolic patterns of meaning. To understand this power means to hold the keys to control the uncertain grounds on which our common social world is constructed.\u201d_\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Meme Manifesto\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/memeManifesto2.png\')} />\\n\\n###### A snapshot of what to expect among the depths of the \u201cmeme iceberg\u201d\\n\\nOn the [Meme Manifesto we bsite](https://mememanifesto.space/) you can embark on a journey through the meme-sphere beginning from the nascent forms of memery, into the depths of niche cultural references and intricate memeified expressions. Prepare yourself, it\u2019s a long way to the bottom. Donations made to this project will go to the artists who wrote and assembled the meme manifesto and its current representations. Check out [Meme Manifesto\u2019s project on Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/meme-manifesto) to learn more of their philosophy and to make a donation.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Black Love Mural Festival\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/blackLoveFestival.png\')} />\\n\\n## Black Love Mural Festival\\n\\nHeld in downtown Denver, Colorado, The Black Love Mural Festival (BLMF) highlights prevailing issues in black society and the cultural anecdotes held within. It is also a celebration of the artistic talent of local black artists in Denver.\\n\\nThe festival itself was created from the momentum generated by the George Floyd protests with the first one taking place in 2020. In a collaboration between Rob The Art Museum and IRL Art, two local entities that organize community events and art exhibitions, they hosted 93 artists who painted murals all over the city, including around the state capital buildings.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Black Love Mural Festival\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/blackLoveFestival2.png\')} />\\n\\n###### _Photo credits:_ [_The Denverite_](https://denverite.com/2020/06/12/black-love-mural-festival-will-showcase-art-by-black-denver-artists-at-civic-center-park/) _and_ [_Black Love Mural Festival_](https://www.blacklovemuralfestival.com/)\\n\\nNow their mission is to prepare for future BLMFs and transfer these works into the digital realm. In 2021, largely resulting from the circumstances of the pandemic, new portals are being created to bring the festival to the blockchain. Several dozen artists have had their works minted as NFTs, to be preserved digitally. BLMF strongly believes that blockchain holds the solutions to empower minority groups and artists with the tools for a better future.\\n\\nFunding received on the BLMF project will go to the volunteer team who not only pay gas in Ethereum to mint NFTs for artists but also continue to educate the BLMF artist community on using blockchain and the Ethereum network.

Utilizing music, culture, and art they have mobilized hands to create and maintain localized nodes of permaculture in over 65 cities for the last 5 years. In more concrete terms, this is executed via **Permaculture Action Days;** an event which organizes various activities including workshops and discussion panels, often in partnership with local music festivals or cultural events. During the event, participants are channeled to aid in the construction of permaculture infrastructure, such as community gardens, rainwater catchment systems and greenhouses.\\n\\nThe heart of activity during the event is the **Permaculture Action Hub**. This is the physical place which brings in curious festival attendees to learn a wide variety of subjects, ranging from alternative economies to mushroom cultivation.\\n\\nAlso featured during Action Days are **Permaculture Action Courses**. These  are free, hands-on classes that teach regenerative ecological techniques and socio-economic structures for individuals and communities.\\n\\nAdapting to the pandemic, the Permaculture Action Network has begun building their next interactive tool: the Just Transition Map. This map will show locations of community spaces and projects that are creating better alternatives to the current extractive economy. This will be a tool for the global environmental justice movement to coordinate and create action. Donations to Permaculture Action Network will help them build the Just Transition Map and to allow the network\u2019s programs to persist through the pandemic.

ETHOS has been championed by \u2018Art Is Solidarity\u2019 which is a local non-profit combining blockchain technology and art mediums to find solutions and funding opportunities for pressing social issues. At the heart of this project is the city\u2019s first initiative: to combat homelessness. From ETHOS\u2019s project description:\\n\\n> \u201cIn 2018, the City of Olympia sanctioned a tent city adjacent to the transit center downtown dubbed the \u201cMitigation Site\u201d for those struggling on the streets to have somewhere to rest and seek shelter. In late 2020, two-and-a-half winters and many tents later, a next step in creating a path to housing for downtowners was conceived when the City of Olympia contracted a local design and build firm to create 60 \u2018micro-houses\u2019 to replace tents and offer more security and safety for those trying to get on their feet.\u201c\\n\\nFollowing the successful construction and installation of these micro-houses, Art Is Solidarity will use additional funds raised to improve upon the amenities inside the Mitigation Site in a unique way. They are engaging the help of local artists to beautify the micro-houses into works of art and mint the art pieces into NFTs to be auctioned off digitally. Proceeds of these auctions will go towards outfitting the house with furniture, heaters and more!\\n\\nArt Is Solidarity also intends to educate the shelter\u2019s inhabitants and local artists about the vast opportunities that NFTs and cryptocurrencies can offer for alternative forms of income, and provide them with the tools to get involved. Check out their [project on Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/ETHOS-Emergency-Transitional-Housing-Offering-Services-1) and donate to help the build and beautification of micro-housing, and the educational opportunities being created for the homeless in Olympia.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Finca Morpho\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-2.png\')}  />  \\n\\nFinca Morpho\\n================\\n\\nNestled in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, there is a community of thriving nomads building ecological harmony at Finca Morpho. This 5-acre beachfront paradise is where humans create strong ties with each other and the land while learning a wide range of skills for a harmonized lifestyle. These skills include permaculture, bamboo building, recycling techniques, holistic medicine, renewable energy, and healthy cooking techniques.\\n\\nFounded in 2014 Finca Morpho is a place for curious travelers to spend time in nature and to fully immerse themselves in communal living. They also host events and retreats to further share the important knowledge they have cultivated on the farm. They have created closed-loop recycling systems from the ground up, having found ways to completely repurpose all of their waste. From a simple sandy beach they have nurtured a thriving permaculture system complete with aquaponics, soil sanctuaries and carbon sequestration techniques. They have come a long way from their humble beginnings.\\n\\nThere are 7 pillars that comprise the core physical and conceptual foundations of the farm: **The Kitchen, The Resource Center, Permaculture, Hospitality, Infrastructure, Project Management and Relationships**. Finca Morpho is seeking funding to upgrade a few of these pillars which need a bit of love in order to maintain and improve their functions. The four pillars needing improvements are:\\n\\n*   **Kitchen** \u2014 To keep feeding hungry mouths and processing the bounty of the land. Buying new equipment such as blenders and stoves.\\n*   **Resource Center** \u2014 To fulfill their mission of recycling or repurposing everything they use. Purchasing a 3d printer, plastic shredder, extruder, microscope and expanding the area of the center.\\n*   **Infrastructure** \u2014 The cabins, water storage system and solar grid they maintain are in need of love. Buying new solar batteries, renovating cabins and installing a new water storage system.\\n*   **Permaculture** \u2014 Every season comes with new challenges and needs. Purchasing seeds, plants and trees.\\n\\nCheck out [Finca Morpho\u2019s project on Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/project/Finca-Morpho) and make a donation to keep this community thriving and capable of spreading its message to those who seek it, and learn more about how they do it on their [website](https://www.fincamorpho.com/).\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Solidity Development Course in Farsi\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-3.png\')}  />  \\n\\nSolidity Development Course in Farsi\\n========================================\\n\\nThe language and gender barriers created by the english-dominated blockchain industry severely hamper opportunities of up-and-coming demographics to fully participate in the revolutionary technology that Blockchain produces. Shayan Eskandari, the project\u2019s creator summarizes the opportunity to provide support:\\n\\n> \u201cFarsi is spoken by an estimated 110 million speakers mostly in Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Russia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan . . . In contrast to the West where computer engineers are predominantly men, Iran\u2019s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates are about 70% women.\u201d\\n\\nCoinIran, the project\u2019s host organization, has built opportunities to overcome these barriers by creating unique programs for Farsi speakers, notably their latest project, \u201cWomen in Blockchain\u2019\u2019. This program is putting Iranian women through the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer bootcamp while providing technical and linguistic support, giving them the knowledge and skills to acquire jobs as Ethereum developers. Their initial cycle put 7 women through the course, who all passed, receiving developer certifications from ConsenSys.\\n\\n**Making Blockchain and Cryptocurrency more accessible will only help to ensure its growth and adoption.** The project is seeking funding to cover the expenses of putting the women through the course and for the costs of building the course tailored for Farsi speakers with comprehensive media, translations and syllabuses. Further funds raised will allow more women to go through the program.

It is the intelligence of nature as expressed through human thought and action.\u201d_. The word is derived from the Greek word **_Oikos_**, meaning \u201chome\u201d. The project, Oika, is reconnecting humans with nature and raising awareness of climate change through NFT technology. Dr. Rich Blundell, the project\u2019s creator, has gathered a team of scientists, artists and storytellers to cultivate _Ecological Intelligence_. They are combining the realms of academic ecological analysis with different artistic techniques to produce images and videos that are minted as NFTs. You can check out their creations on the [Oika Media page](https://oika.com/oika-media-projects).\\n\\nOika also maintains an off-grid homestead and marine research vessel for inspired researchers to collaborate, incubating new ideas and generating knowledge. There are a wide variety of subjects that Oika advocates research on, such as:\\n\\n*   Ecological Survey & Monitoring\\n*   Invasive Species Response\\n*   Pelagic/Neritic, Plastics Clean-up\\n*   Fishing Debris Location & Removal\\n*   Wildlife Reporting & Monitoring\\n*   Aquaculture Research\\n*   Phenology (study of climate change effects)\\n*   Citizen Science\\n*   Sci-Art Collaboration\\n*   Public Interpretation/Communication\\n*   Conservation Journalism/Documentary\\n\\nOika also offers courses for teaching the concepts of Ecological Intelligence. They seek funding to continue operating their off-grid research center and to pay artists and scientists for their contributions and collaborations involved in crafting the NFTs.

Grassroots Economics is proving this concept by building open-source economies in communities throughout Kenya. Their base token. known as Community Inclusion Currency (CIC). is to be used across all their participating communities in order to quantify and redistribute the abundance of goods they produce.\\n\\nTheir vision is to create healthy and decentralized ecosystems by empowering locals to design their own economies. They also believe heavily in syntropic agroforestry as the main technique to provide agricultural abundance and economic value production.\\n\\nThey seek funding in order to build the open-source software they need in order to achieve their goals. Development currently takes place on their [public repository on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics).

Rainbow Crystal Land (RCL), established in 2014, strives to create a global network of leaderless, horizontally structured communities that live in harmony with each other and the Earth. Currently they operate out of their main hub in San Agustin but are seeking to build a global community that shares their philosophy. They are mostly donation based but also sell the food they grow on the land to the local markets. All of these funds go into their \u201cMagic Hat\u201d which is used to buy necessary food and pay overhead costs to continue their existence.\\n\\nThey have written a [comprehensive handbook](https://rainbowcrystal.land/document/handbook/) detailing many aspects of their organization, including their declaration of Common Intention as well as their Mission, Vision and Values. On the land they maintain several houses for families and dormitories for their human inhabitants. They operate a solar grid for closed-loop electricity provision and also a permaculture farm on their 14 hectare plot of land.\\n\\nRCL is seeking funding to improve much of their existing infrastructure. They are hoping to purchase treated bamboo and other wood to finish building their housing projects. Tools and plant supplies need to be bought to begin putting to use their recently acquired land.

They provide resources for disaster relief workers and environmental conservationists. The biodiversity contained in Costa Rica cannot be understated and the preservation of the plethora of unique flora and fauna in this region is paramount to the Multiversity\u2019s mission. They currently steward a land area of 1235 acres located within the Barra del Colorado National Refuge which has been designated by UNESCO as one of most important places for natural conservation.\\n\\nCurrently, Colorado Multiversity operates out of a biological station called \u201cEl Zota\u201d, which is one of the Multiversity\u2019s partners. El Zota carries out research and training for those who are passionate about conservation and biodiversity. There is also The Refuge Project, another one of the Multiversity\u2019s organizations, that utilizes the facility as a safe space for disaster relief workers worldwide to meet, rest, teach and learn.\\n\\nThe Colorado Multiversity has been recognized by some notable organizations for potential funding, including the SDG Impact Fund, Gaia Gives and the Spanish Cooperation. They are seeking initial funding to kick-start their mission and meet the funding criteria outlined by these organizations. They have a wide range of projects being launched including decarbonization initiatives, international volunteering programs, agricultural development research and plastic recycling.

In Vancouver the homeless population is ever-present and expanding. The temperate climate of southern BC has allowed this region to become a year-round hub for the Canadian demographic experiencing homelessness. The problem in Chilliwack is exacerbated as the city of Vancouver rounds up the homeless on one-way buses to Chilliwack, dropping them off in the town with no return.\\n\\nFeeding the hungry is a simple and powerful gesture. David\u2019s trusty team, consisting of him and his daughter, plans to create food packages to hand out to the population experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack. David is seeking funding to purchase ingredients for the food packages, cover gas costs and pay for lodging expenses. At the time of writing this article, David\u2019s team is gearing up and getting ready to execute their plan in the coming weeks. Funds contributed to this project will allow them to scale their mission and feed more people.

The voices of women are extremely important and often underrepresented so WOCA is championing the presence of women in the crypto sphere. They share ideas and information and promote each other\u2019s work across all realms of cryptocurrency. In 6 short months their community has quickly grown to over 400 members.\\n\\nWOCA has kept pace with their rapid growth, improving their organization in many ways. They\u2019ve built a website to showcase their community talent, they launched a Colony DAO to manage their thriving tribe and have formed great relationships with entities such as Panvala and Cryptovoxels. WOCA is seeking funding to reach their next milestones, including building a permanent gallery, onboarding members to the DAO and promoting all of the incredible work done by women artists.

The entire country faces extreme food security challenges, driven by political and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to finding food security solutions for one of the most important, yet vulnerable groups in society: the children. The project\u2019s owner, Tim Olsson, believes that satisfying the nutritional needs of children allows them to focus on their education and development. Children will create the future of tomorrow and providing them with the means to succeed will help them overcome the challenges we still face today.\\n\\nVukani\u2019s immediate goal is to grow food to nourish the local school children. Research is needed to find an agricultural system that works in the unique conditions of Zimbabwe. Once an effective system is found by the initial pilot project, their aim is to scale up and one day serve the entire country. Progress has been made for finding a water source but more infrastructure needs to be acquired to effectively distribute it for irrigation. Funds to this project will help make purchases for water pumps and solar-powered irrigation systems.

Harnessing the knowledge of Syntropic Farming they have launched their project along the lush rural roads of Costa Rica. According to Devin & Arthur, Free the Food\u2019s co-founders, Syntropic Farming is the gateway to restoring ecological diversity, creating wildlife habitats and holistically super-charging the generation of delicious and healthy food.\\n\\nThey have already begun with three streetside syntropic plantations to grow food, with more sites on the way. Their grand vision is to create a network of streetside syntropics and to engineer a grants system allowing new communities to spring up, acquiring the knowledge to begin propagating these regenerative food sources. They are seeking funding now to develop their website and purchase irrigation tools, water tanks, seeds, tools, as well as to provide a monthly budget for 1 employee.

We released our MVP DApp in 2018 to be beta tested by the Giveth Galaxy, but faced huge obstacles. Scope creep, maintenance of a complex system, and an overly complicated user experience prevented a quick release, and then we simply ran out of funding. We were close to \u201ccalling it quits\u201d on our original DApp in favour of a simpler, [user-friendly version](https://giveth.io/) that we would design from scratch.\\n\\nFortunately for Givers everywhere, our all-star devs refused to give up. We assembled a team around the DApp and worked tirelessly for months on stabilization and beautification. With our hearts full of joy and our hats in our hands, we are proud to finally come out of beta and release TRACE to the world.\\n\\n**Giveth TRACE is no longer a wistful dream of something that could have been \u2014 it\u2019s a reality!**\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAllow us to proudly present a platform that lifts the veil between Givers and their donations in action. A platform that empowers projects to create highly customizable online representations to attract real supporters. A platform that emphasizes the development of trust between all parties \u2014 the Givers, the projects and the greater community. We proudly present: [Giveth TRACE](http://trace.giveth.io/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=traceLaunch).\\n\\n<img  alt=\\"Memery - Traceable Donations\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/traceLaunchMeme1.jpeg\')}  />\\n\\n\\nProject Verification\\n====================\\n\\n<img class=\\"leftfloat\\" width=\\"250\\" height=\\"auto\\" alt=\\"Verified Project Badge\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/traceLaunchPhoto1.png\')}  />\\n\\n\\nGivers using TRACE know that their donations are going to top-quality legitimate projects thanks to our project verification system. In order to add a project as a Campaign on Giveth TRACE, a Maker must first add their project to [giveth.io](http://giveth.io) and apply to become verified. Currently this process is informal, but soon it will be integrated into the project flow. For now, if you want to verify your project, fill [out this typeform](https://hlfkiwoiwhi.typeform.com/to/pXxk0HO5) and reach out in the #project-onboarding channel on our [Discord](https://discord.giveth.io).\\n\\nAccountability\\n==============\\n\\nCampaigns represent the big picture for each project \u2014 projects use Campaigns to collect traceable donations and manage them transparently. Under each Campaign there can be multiple \u201c[Traces](/dapps/leavingTraces)\u201d, i.e. payments, bounties, or expenses. Traces specify how the project is using their donations to achieve the goals of the overarching Campaigns. When a Giver donates to a Campaign they can follow the flow of their donations. Whenever donations are moved from a Campaign to a Trace, the Giver is notified and can see exactly how their donations are used.\\n\\nTraces are the only way for donations to leave Giveth TRACE. Every project on the platform will have to explain how they are using the donations before collecting them.\\n\\n**This way, the Campaigns are held accountable to the Givers and the Givers can see their donations in action!**\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n<img  alt=\\"TRACE campaign page\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/traceLaunchPhoto2.png\')}  />\\n\\n\\n###### Campaigns Live on [Giveth TRACE](https://www.trace.giveth.io/)\\n\\nDonor Empowerment\\n=================\\n\\nNot sure which Campaign to donate to? Giveth TRACE also offers \u201cCommunities\u201d, which represent people and projects united by common goals and initiatives. When you donate to a Community, you are donating to a cause that you believe in! [Communities can delegate donations to Campaigns or to specific Traces](/dapps/entitiesAndRoles), and each time donations are delegated, the Giver can choose to veto the movement.\\n\\nIn this way, Giveth TRACE builds on blockchain technology with an added layer of donor empowerment that has never before been possible. **Givers don\u2019t have to trust that their donations are flowing to projects they believe in, they can actively ensure it.**\\n\\n### But wait \u2014 there\u2019s more\u2026\\n\\n\\nFree Gas for Giveth TRACE Projects\\n==================================\\n\\n<img  alt=\\"Memery - Free gas, gas station\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/traceLaunchMeme3.jpeg\')}  />\\n\\n\\nOn Giveth TRACE, Giveth pays the gas fees so projects don\u2019t have to!\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGiveth TRACE makes use of two networks in order to address security and scalability issues. Our use of Rinkeby testnet [makes it free to perform basic site interactions](https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060), such as creating a Trace, managing donations, or updating a profile. However, in order to collect or disburse donations from a Trace, [Ethereum gas fees must still be paid](/dapps/bridgeSecurity/) to get the donations to the final recipient on mainnet. We are excited to financially support each project on Giveth TRACE while also protecting them from the difficult user experience and the complications of the Ethereum network, so we cover their gas costs!\\n\\nYou can see the total gas Giveth paid for each Campaign, Trace or Individual on TRACE \u2014 and can even share it with your friends.\\n\\n<img  alt=\\"Memery - Traceable Donations\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/traceLaunchPhoto4.png\')}  />\\n\\n\\n###### Total Gas Paid for the [Commons Stack Community Campaign](https://www.trace.giveth.io/campaign/commons-stack-community-iteration-0) on Giveth TRACE  \\n\\nOur mission at Giveth is to bridge the non-profit and blockchain worlds, connecting people, ideas and resources with free, open source decentralized applications.

The project\u2019s creator, Mugisha, states that in rural Burundi up to **58% of children suffer from malnutrition** and communities often have no access to medical services. Agriculture and livestock can represent up to 95% of a village\u2019s commercial activities, yet families still struggle to get enough food to sustain themselves.\\n\\nPVC Burundi began in 2015 and is teaching rural communities how to implement regenerative systems for improving education, agriculture and healthcare. Activities focus on soil regeneration, organic waste recycling, tree planting, and of course, growing food. PVC Burundi provides healthcare access to communities in exchange for tree-planting services, incentivizing a healthy environment in tandem with healthy humans.\\n\\nFood sold in markets via Village Communities are used to fund PVC\u2019s healthcare and education initiatives. Every year they launch \u201cCommunity Reconciliation\u201d where they expose new communities to different regenerative techniques, begin tree planting campaigns and bring food to market. Currently, one of their main goals is to extend their healthcare facilities in Burundi.\\n\\n[Check out Perfect Villages in Burundi](https://giveth.io/project/CREATING-THE-PERFECT-VILLAGES-IN-BURUNDI) and help spread the regenerative movement in Africa!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Bridging Digital Communities\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'/img/blog/changeMakersFinal2.png\')}  />\\n\\nBridging Digital Communities\\n============================\\n\\nIs run by a Digital Wizard by the name of Kay. He creates online bridges that allow communities to stay connected. In the decentralized world of Blockchain, communities can spring up seemingly out of nowhere, forming around causes, concepts, technologies or protocols. In this rapidly growing part of the world wide web, communities thrive off of the collective innovation and synergy of ideas, exponentiated greatly by the digital bridges that Kay creates. He has been creating and maintaining bridge servers for applications such as Discord, Telegram or Riot and has never charged anyone to make these connections. He bridges quite a few notable Ethereum projects such as: Matic, Gitcoin, 1hive, Conensys, Aragon and even Giveth (Thanks Kay! \ud83d\ude09)\\n\\nKay has a project on Giveth \u2014 the proceeds of which go into funding the work he does building bridges and keeping digital communities connected.

Wren Fialka, the founder, started it all by asking a man experiencing homelessness one question: \u201cIf there was a bag of items that I could bring you tomorrow to make your day-to-day life easier, what would be in the bag?\u201d. Based on their simple approach focused on \u201cConnection, Compassion and Vital Supplies\u201d they have been serving communities across the US for the last 6 years.\\n\\nOn the Spread the Love project page they state that anywhere between 600,000 to 1.5 million people experience homelessness across the country, and with Covid-19 financial support ending soon, that number is likely to rise. With only one employee, Spread the Love Commission needs to grow in order to meet these rising challenges. So far they have served over 30 communities and with Giver support they hope to serve many more.\\n\\nSpread the Love Commission aims to remove the stigma of homelessness and connect those stuck in a vicious cycle with support from those who are ready to offer it. With sustainability, compassion and persistence they hope to end the homelessness crisis once and for all.\\n\\n[Visit the Spread the Love Commission Giveth project page](https://giveth.io/project/spread-the-love-commission) to find out more and help them fund their critical mission!\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap!

They are catalyzing action to restore lands and protect water resources. Based in the Diamante Valley, Costa Rica, their goal is to strengthen connections to local culture and lands by building an integrated village designed to support human development and regenerate local ecosystems. They are nurturing holistic ways of living in order to live in harmony with humanity and Mother Earth.

In the game, you travel back in time to use cadCAD as a tool to help a community design a regenerative Commons with the potential to save the world from total planetary and economic destruction. The first level is live and you can play it right now on [https://sim.commonsstack.org](https://sim.commonsstack.org).\\n\\nDeveloped by the Commons Stack Dev community, the Commons Simulator illustrates one of the core missions of the Commons Stack: Empowering communities to design their own economies using open source simulation tools. Donations to this project on Giveth will go towards expanding the game by adding another level with a new story and new mechanics, such as the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751).

A common challenge in Tanzania is solid waste management, including in Njombe. Mettodo, the project\u2019s creator states:\\n\\n> \u2018 35 tons of solid waste is generated daily by the town: 28 tons are taken to a dumpsite, where the waste is usually burned . . . 10 % of the solid waste is plastic waste: 3,500 kg of per day, which is equal to 1000 tons of plastic waste every year.\u2019\\n\\nNjombe Beyond is working hard to reduce the plastic wasted in Njombe town. Their three specific objectives are:\\n\\n*   Establish a small scale value chain for recycling plastics within the local community.\\n*   Collaborate with stakeholders of the program and ensure fair working conditions.\\n*   Involve schools and local communities in Njombe Beyond to bring awareness to the problems and opportunities of plastic waste.\\n\\n[Check out Njombe Beyond\u2019s project on Giveth!](https://giveth.io/project/njombe-beyond)\\n\\nWhen we first set out on the change-maker campaign we had decided to wrap things up on the 12th of May, but after some discussion we have decided to **extend the change-maker campaign** indefinitely.

We improved upon our email notifications, ensuring that Givers and Makers receive confirmation when a donation is made.\\n\\nWe developed and implemented automated testing for the create-a-project flow and updated the [testing guidelines](https://docs.giveth.io/docs/testing-guidelines/) in our documentation \u2014 two measures to ensure that new features work as intended.\\n\\nWe also addressed a few bugs: ensured that cancelled projects don\u2019t show up in the projects list, fixed pricing, and rerouted external links for xDai donations to blockscout.\\n\\nOne of our all-star developers also surprised us this past sprint with a proof of concept: building Giveth.io using Next.js and Vercel instead of Gatsby and Netlify. Once we make sure all our functionality is bug-free, this change will drastically improve the UX. We\u2019re talking faster site build, fewer issues on loading and updating, and an overall snappier site experience.\\n\\nIn the future, we\u2019re going to be enhancing the UI so Makers will be able to upload photos via Unsplash when editing or creating a project. We are in the process of updating our Join, About, Contact and Support sections to the most recent info. We are also still working on the integration of an embedded chat bridged directly to our team, and project/profile verification using 3box or other.\\n\\nFinally, the most exciting update to share is that we are working on giving the site a little makeover. We won\u2019t give too much away, but here\u2019s a little sneak peak of the new design:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Working on a New Look for Giveth.io\\" class=\\"center\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/whatsDappening3img2.jpg\')} />\\n\\n###### Working on a New Look for Giveth.io\\n\\nWe want to extend a huge thank you to our community for all your support so far!

It\u2019s been an exciting couple of months for Giveth. We\u2019ve come hot off the heels from the Giveth.io launch right into this opportunity to hear about projects making a difference across the globe. We\u2019ve received **six outstanding submissions** that we would like to highlight in our first roundup. Without further ado here they are!\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## **Sage to Saddle**\\n\\naims to focus Native American youth on healthy lifestyle alternatives, rising above the poverty and substance abuse that they often live with. Nate Bressler realized while on photo-assignment shooting Native American horse racing teams for Outside Magazine, that a winter horse riding facility would greatly benefit the community of Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He teamed up with Lakota Native, Stan Brewer, the driving force behind Pine Ridge\u2019s horse community and Angela Smith, who grew up in Utah and has been involved in nonprofits her whole life. Together, they created lofty but attainable goals that will bring structure, education, celebration, along with the opportunity for these Native youth to lift their chins with pride.\\n\\nThis project hopes to provide an after-school program for kids 8\u201318 focused on equine relationships in an indoor horse riding arena. Students of the program will be granted the opportunity to learn and grow while carrying on a traditional relationship with the very animal that made their ancestors\u2019 survival possible. [Check out Sage to Saddle on Giveth here!](https://giveth.io/project/sage-to-saddle/)\\n\\n## **Conscious Medicine Collective**\\n\\ndreams to create a one-of-a-kind psychedelic consciousness center. Manex Ibar and Victoria Ibar, partners and founders, intend to create powerful experiences to bring together creativity, music, art, and high-end healing. The intention is to gather medical practitioners and influencers together into a club that fosters innovation, problem solving, and creative solutions through the use of plant medicines, psychedelics, and consciousness programs. They seek funding to establish their center on 12 acres of land they already have purchased in the picturesque Basque Pyren\xe9es. Conscious Medicine Collective aims to bring magic, nature and wonder into an experiential club center that provides elevation of consciousness. [Venture over to their Giveth project page.](https://giveth.io/project/conscious-medicine-collective/)\\n\\n## **Trust Graphic Novel**\\n\\nis a transmedia project by Blockchain Philanthropy Champion Anne Connelly and accomplished artist and storyteller Chief Nyamweya. Both a graphic novel and motion comic, it is set in a future African nation that tells the story of Moraa, a young woman who learns about blockchain and uses it to protect her homeland from cultural and ecological destruction. By using storytelling to educate readers about blockchain technology, they hope to inspire African youth to see a bright future and link them to the training to create it. Currently Anne and her team are partnered with groups in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. The book will cover the basics of blockchains and cryptocurrency, and provide resources and links to their African-based educational partners. [You can find their Giveth project here.](https://giveth.io/project/trust-graphic-novel-and-motion-comic/)\\n\\n## **Bloom Network**\\n\\nrepresents an international community of people and projects working toward regenerative cultures. Local Bloom hubs around the world grow participation in practices such as food security, local economies, celebrations of diversity, and art as cultural transformation. There are tens of thousands of initiatives solving major social and environmental problems, who are excluded from mainstream media and institutional finance because the way they work is naturally collaborative and polycentric. Three big picture goals the Bloom Network hopes to achieve are:\\n\\n*   Inspire a billion acts of regeneration.\\n*   Build capacity and relationships across regenerative culture initiatives.\\n*   Transfer power and resources to decentralized networks.\\n\\nContributions made to their project will go towards \u201cRegenerative Actions Ticker\u201d on their homepage, DAO templates that local Bloom chapters can use to fund the coordination labor of actions and launch the \u201cCall to Bloom\u201d that will help 100+ local Blooms get started as centers of regenerative action in their cities. [Donate to Bloom Network on Giveth.io!](https://giveth.io/project/bloom-network/)\\n\\n## **Must Have Crypto**\\n\\nis a Cryptocurrency project based out of Kenya led by Mutinda Kisio. The Project is about teaching the masses about Crypto while enabling them to earn a daily basic income. They have minted their own token and plan to use it to teach low income individuals and families about how to use cryptocurrency by providing a steady stream of airdrops up to a maximum of a 1000 addresses. Mutinda is seeking funding to back the value of the token and provide real value to the tokens that are being airdropped. [Make a Contribution to Must Have Crypto on their Giveth project page.](https://giveth.io/project/musthavecrypto/)\\n\\n## **Diamante Bridge Collective**\\n\\nis a group of land stewards in the Diamante Valley, Costa Rica working together to create collective foundational agreements and a local regenerative economy that includes digital currencies for the transparent and accountable recordkeeping of their exchanges. They are building bridges between communities and organizations, local and global cultures, property owners and skilled service providers who are committed to working together long term to care for their bio-region, their neighbors, and the community at large. The Diamante Bridge Collective functions as a hub of many physical nodes, connected via global networks of shared vision and missions with the goal of restoring, preserving and consciously stewarding surrounding lands and watersheds while living harmoniously within them in alignment with planetary values. Donations will help develop infrastructure systems to support growing communities.

This is one part of a series of short transparency posts where we keep you in the loop with updates on what\u2019s in development for_ [_giveth.io_](http://giveth.io)_._\\n\\nOur new DApp [went live](2021-03-24-futureofGiving.md) at [giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) on March 24, 2021, and since then we got some great feedback from our testers and community, and we\u2019ve been hard at work fixing bugs and adding new features.\\n\\nFirst, we addressed the issue of gas fees not being calculated correctly, added an informative banner, and enabled users to login directly on xDai chain. We disabled the ability of a project creator to use a contract address for their project so that donations to all projects can be done either on Mainnet or xDai. We also added more tokens to our list in order to allow the Giver to donate with even more flexibility!\\n\\nWe onboarded a new member into our dev team and thanks to him we now have functional automated testing that allows us to make changes to the DApp in development and then push to our testing site with greater confidence.\\n\\nNext we tackled a bigger fish: the development and implementation of a quality score, sorting/filtering method, and search function to add greater flow and organization to the projects page.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Magic Sorting\\" class=\\"leftfloat\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/whatsDappening1Meme.gif\')} width=\\"375\\" height=\\"auto\\" />\\n\\nNow the projects are sorted by default using a \u201cquality score\u201d \u2014 a combination of number of likes, number of donations and quality of project description. We have also added the ability for the user to filter projects by category, and to change the sorting method from the default to \u201cnumber of likes\u201d or \u201camount raised\u201d.\\n\\n\\nLastly, you are now able to use the search bar to quickly and easily find the exact project you want to view or Give to!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Filter and Sort on Giveth.io\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/whatsDappening1img1.png\')} width=\\"800\\" height=\\"auto\\" />\\n\\n###### \u201cFilter by Category\u201d, \u201cSort By\u201d and \u201cSearch Projects\u201d Features on [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/)\\n\\nAnother exciting update is that we\u2019re now using [Segment](https://segment.com/) analytics and [Autopilot](https://www.autopilothq.com/) to track activity on the DApp and send appropriate corresponding notifications. We also worked on some internal organization in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/JftjK8Un3z) that enables us to receive notifications so we can monitor site actions (such as new project creation, new donation, etc.) in-house.\\n\\nIn the next sprint we\u2019re excited to continue with QA by getting email notifications working smoothly and ensuring that the donation amount (at time of donation) is being calculated and added to the database correctly. We also plan to add rich text formatting to the project creation flow, and enable the Maker to add videos and/or images to their project description. Furthermore, we are now developing systems for project verification to increase the quality of projects on the DApp.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks we will be investigating fiat integration for on-ramping and off-ramping solutions, and continuing to work on creating a white-label option.\\n\\nAs always, we are committed to building the future of giving based on feedback from you, our community!

WOW! Much Excite! The pre-existing Giveth henceforth will be known as Giveth TRACE. The [new Giveth.io Donation Application](https://giveth.io/) is an important continuation of our mission to build the future of giving. Both iterations will continue to exist and do contain different features. In this article we\u2019ll be diving into the nitty gritty to help you decide which version of Giveth will aid you the most on your philanthropic venture.\\n\\n<a href=\\"#summary\\">TL;DR</a> \u2190\\n----------------\\n\\nThree key distinguishers of the Giveths are: **_Trust_**, **_User Experience,_** and **_Scope_**. Let\u2019s dive in.\\n\\n**_Trust_**\\n===========\\n\\nFirst up let\u2019s talk about Trust. Giveth TRACE (Originally Giveth Beta) was launched in 2017. Following [the great DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) from the previous year, the burning question at the time was: how do we make these new decentralized innovations resilient and trustworthy? Giveth itself was on the frontlines of these events and set out to solve these issues.\\n\\nGiveth TRACE employs smart contracts to handle various transparency-oriented functions of the platform. These interactions happen on the blockchain, including traceable donations, escrow, and dispersal of funds. It uses Milestones for specific projects or goals that can have conditions outlined for funds to be released. An example would be to prove work was done on a project or that money was spent to acquire something specific. The milestone contract is employed to act as an escrow. A milestone creator can designate a recipient other than themselves and also a reviewer. The reviewer of a milestone is responsible to assure that any stated expectations were completed before authorizing the smart contract to release the funds to the recipient.\\n\\nThe new Giveth DApp does not use smart contracts to facilitate donations but instead provides a true peer-to-peer experience where funds go directly from donor to receiver. The resulting transaction is eternally scribed onto the blockchain. There are no escrow or reviewer functions on the Giveth.io DApp so while donations are much more direct, you are encouraged to do your due diligence before donating.\\n\\n**_User Experience_**\\n=====================\\n\\nFollowing the rise of \u2018cryptokitties\u2019 and the mooning of the price of ETH in 2018, the Rinkeby test network was implemented on Giveth TRACE to resolve absurd gas fees and scalability issues. This allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Dapp for no actual fees, using only gas on Rinkeby to execute the majority of contract transactions. In fact, Giveth actually pays the fees to send your donations to mainnet.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"leftfloat\\"  src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/cryptokitties.png\')} width=\\"450\\" height=\\"auto\\" />\\n\\n**_\u201cThe Rise and Fall of Ethereum circa 2018 AD\u201d_**\\n###### Image Source: medium.com\\n\\nProfile creation on Giveth TRACE is facilitated by smart contract interactions on Rinkeby and is reasonably straightforward, however is currently limited to MetaMask. Giveth TRACE currently allows donations in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC and USDC.\\n\\nGiveth.io has expanded giving capabilities by allowing donations in ETH and any ERC-20 Token on Mainnet and [**xDai network**](https://www.xdaichain.com/)! The [Giveth.io DApp](https://giveth.io/) uses Onboard.js to permit virtually any Ethereum wallet to be used for donations. Project creation has been streamlined, so creators can sign-in, make a project and start collecting funds literally in minutes. For creating a profile you may choose between standard MetaMask login or Torus Wallet. Torus Wallet also provides a crypto on-ramping feature so you can convert your cold-hard cash into cryptocurrency very easily and get to donating in the digital age. [More Info on Torus wallet can be found here.](https://docs.tor.us/)\\n\\n**_Scope_**\\n===========\\n\\nScope  is the last, but perhaps coolest, distinction I want to mention. Giveth TRACE has **huge** scope: its donation hierarchy is broken down into Communities (formerly known as DACs), Campaigns, and Milestones. Donations made to Communities and Campaigns are stored in a \u2018pledge\u2019 vault. The Community or Campaign manager can then delegate your pledge into the Campaign or Milestone, respectively, of their choosing. This system created by Giveth has coined the term \u2018Liquid Pledging\u2019 and in effect allows for curated donor funds. This means would-be donors can make non-custodial contributions to causes that they care about and funds can find their way to the right place at the right time. Once your funds have been delegated you\u2019re able to track where they went on Giveth TRACE.\\n\\nGiveth.io Dapp aims to provide a simpler experience. While not achieving the same scope of Giveth TRACE it is much easier to navigate. Donations made on Giveth.io go straight A \u2192 B and the project owners themselves dictate the scope by the projects they choose to create.\\n\\n<span id=\\"summary\\">**_To Summarize:_**</span>\\n===================\\n\\n_Giveth TRACE_\\n--------------\\n\\n*   Allows for donations on macro and micro levels via Communities, Campaigns, and Milestones\\n*   Has a system of oversight to prevent misuse or fraud\\n*   Donations accepted in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC, and USDC\\n*   Curated Donor Funds via \u2018Liquid Pledging\u2019\\n*   Giveth doesn\u2019t charge any fees, in fact we pay the fees to send funds to the recipient\\n*   Works with MetaMask\\n\\nGiveth.io\\n---------\\n\\n*   Streamlined project creation accessible for all\\n*   Multi-wallet functionality\\n*   Peer-to-peer transactions\\n*   Giveth doesn\u2019t charge any fees\\n*   Fiat donations via Torus On-ramping\\n*   ETH and ERC-20 token donations\\n*   Donate on **xDai** and save on gas\\n\\nThe new Giveth is straightforward if you\u2019re looking to make simple donations peer to peer without any added complexity but with more connectivity. Giveth TRACE allows you to define how broad or narrow your donations are while maintaining a high standard of transparency and checks on fund flow. Each has specific advantages in terms of collecting donations. Check out both and decide which flavor suits your taste; [Giveth TRACE](https://beta.giveth.io/) or [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/).\\n\\n## Want to get more involved?\\n\\n\\n*   Join us on [Discord](https://discord.giveth.io) or [Telegram](http://t.me/givethio)\\n*   Discover our [Site](http://giveth.io/) and [Wiki](https://wiki.giveth.io/)\\n*   Fork our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Giveth/)\\n*   Follow us on [Medium](http://medium.com/giveth/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/givethio), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/givethio) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/)\\n\\nHelp us Build the Future of Giving: \ud83e\udd84 [Donate directly](http://donate.giveth.io/) \ud83e\udd84 or [buy a Ledger with our affiliate link](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s?utm_source=&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=d663)"},{"id":"futureofGiving","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/futureofGiving","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-24-futureofGiving.md","title":"The Future of Giving is Here","description":"We are very excited to announce the launch of Giveth at giveth.io \u2014 a free, open-source donation application for community philanthropy featuring an all-new UI/UX.","date":"2021-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"24 de marzo de 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":2.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lauren","title":"Blockchain DAbbler and Heart-Centered Jack of All Trades","imageURL":"/img/laurenAuthor.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"futureofGiving","title":"The Future of Giving is Here","author":"Lauren","author_title":"Blockchain DAbbler and Heart-Centered Jack of All Trades","author_image_url":"/img/laurenAuthor.png","image":"/img/blog/futureofGivingimg1.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Two Flavors of Giveth..

Our flagship DApp (live for 3 years at beta.giveth.io) is now being rebranded as \u201cGiveth TRACE\u201d. Giveth TRACE offers a platform for peer-to-peer donations on the blockchain with detailed traceability for \u201cGivers\u201d and mutual aid projects. However, it does require some knowledge of Ethereum and wallet management.\\n\\n**_With the new Giveth, project owners anywhere in the world can publish an online profile and start accepting donations within minutes._**\\n\\n<img alt=\\"\\"  src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/futureofGivingmeme1.jpeg\')} width=\\"500\\" height=\\"auto\\" />\\n\\n###### Image Credit: Grandma Finds the Internet via [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/)\\n\\n<img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"leftfloat\\"  src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/futureofGivingSignIn.png\')} width=\\"375\\" height=\\"auto\\"  />\\n\\n###### Screenshot taken from [Giveth](https://giveth.io/)\\n\\nBoth Torus and MetaMask wallets are fully integrated into the DApp, meaning that a blockchain newbie can create a wallet with Torus by signing in via social media as easily as the crypto-savvy can sign in with their MetaMask browser extension. Torus integration also means that Giveth is compatible with mobile and a wide range of desktop browsers.\\n\\nOnce logged in, a \u201cMaker\u201d can follow the highly intuitive step-by-step project creation flow and begin raising funds in crypto right away with zero fees added by Giveth.\\n\\n**_100% of every donation goes directly to the project.

A Gift creates a Surplus as it spreads. _~ Seth Godin_\\n\\nGiveth is exploring new territories and expanding its horizons: we are embarking on an exciting mission to enrich the Giveth Donation Application by **making the core part of it, the donations, more sustainable**. From enabling Givers to donate to the causes they believe in and providing a layer of [transparency and accountability](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4) through our [DApp](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp), we will now be tackling the sustainability of the donation process itself. **We want to create continuous streams of funding through the creation of economies around causes**, by building a system of [token bonding curves](https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8) feeding cause-focused DAOs (with a unique governance model) on top of the Giveth DApp, in a collaboration with [BlockScience](https://block.science/).\\n\\n_Edit May 2019: for more on the Commons Stack initiative, read_ [_this most recent update_](https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-e1293123831d) _by_ [_Jeff Emmett_](https://medium.com/u/ae6d20c4931e?source=post_page-----ac265e3010b8--------------------------------)_, for a technical deepdive by_ [_Abbey Titcomb_](https://medium.com/u/5967a5d3b611?source=post_page-----ac265e3010b8--------------------------------) _go_ [_here_](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436)_._\\n\\n**_From centralized Donations to sustainable Collaborations_**\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you have been following Giveth closely, you will know by now that we are not your regular organization and are constantly changing our own collaboration models through many experiments, and that we are involved in [many](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-partners-with-alibre-io-for-last-mile-solution-in-mexico-50c5155dfcd5), [many](https://medium.com/giveth/the-unicorndac-a-non-hierarchical-decentralized-governance-experiment-8dfbe6e98d19) [initiatives](https://medium.com/aragon-dac/aragon-dac-a-new-community-effort-to-foster-aragons-development-led-by-giveth-2228dcc17b63), seemingly not moving in just one specific direction, but actually, we are! **We are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (DAC) focused on making the World a Better Place** through the use of blockchain technology, and yes, this is a wide and ambitious [mission](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/mission/). But we have a path we are on, well, actually we have several, and we are doing this on purpose, to make us more resilient, even antifragile. The Ethereum community and the blockchain space as a whole is in constant flux, so we are working on and supporting a wide array of different initiatives (we call it the [Giveth Galaxy](https://giveth.io/#galaxy)) that we believe are bringing lasting value to the wider community.\\n\\nDuring this cryptowinter, we ourselves, as a non-profit blockchain-based entity, have been struggling quite a bit to keep financially afloat and have only been able to do this through a generous donation by [an anonymous donor](https://medium.com/giveth/surprise-285-eth-anonymous-donation-given-to-giveth-9167266a5085), but mostly through a constant stream of [personal donations by our co-founder Griff Green](https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5b37da13a239ac21b383d4da), for which we are eternally grateful. This scarcity however got us to discuss our own sustainability quite a bit, and the importance of good, objective governance that will benefit our individual and collective interests, our \u2018Commons\u2019. **Depending on pure goodwill, even if it happens in a transparent and accountable way, is not sustainable**, not for us nor for any other altruistic community: it puts you in a scarcity mindset and is a heavy distraction from the cause(s) that unite you. This concern made us see more clearly than ever that we have to invest time in bringing Giving to the next level, and change the way humans collaborate.\\n\\n**_1\u20132\u20133 \u2014 Infinity._**\\n-----------------------\\n\\nFirst things first, we are very happy and proud to say that **our flagship project, the Giveth DApp,** [**currently in beta**](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/)**, is now** [feature-complete](https://medium.com/giveth/whats-dappening-0x5-ultra-configurable-milestones-27ff92383de2)**,** bringing us very close to what we could call \u2018Giveth 1.0\u2019. This of course does not mean that we will stop working on the DApp, on the contrary, much more is coming, such as deploying our DApp on the [xDAI chain](https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-partners-with-makerdao-on-xdai-chain-the-first-ever-usd-stable-blockchain-65a078c41e6a), introducing governance solutions through [Aragon](http://aragon.org), a complete UX overhaul and so much more. This is all in the making but in order to continue with this, we are currently focusing very hard on the funding part of the puzzle**.** We want to help forward the ecosystem itself through an ambitious token-engineering experiment, in collaboration with [BlockScience](https://block.science/). **The target of this experiment is to transform communities around altruistic causes into entire economies and to build this on top of the Giveth DApp.** In the coming months, we will be working hard on this initiative that will bring us at some point to what we like to call \u2018Giveth 2.0\u2019.\\n\\nNow that we have traceable donations working in the DApp, we can start to experiment with new models to support both the organization as well as the funding of communities. Your support stays very, very welcome ([all tokens accepted](http://giveth.io/donate) \ud83d\ude4f) but in the long run, we want to incentivize you so that you are no longer just a Giver, but have a real stake in the success of the community you will be supporting: **we want to align the very human behavior of profit-seeking with socially beneficial behavior: to us this is the real Future of Giving**.\\n\\nWe built the foundational layer of our Giveth DApp on the Ethereum blockchain and not on a centralized server to bring **true accountability and transparency to decentralized governance experiments**: there is an immutable piece of evidence of what happened with your funds. The true magic however, that will allow us to create sustainable streams of funding, lies hidden within the existing dynamics of blockchain technology. **Every blockchain network in existence has aligned incentives around supporting the network itself: every \u2018actor\u2019 in the system, when acting in their own best interest, actually benefits the system.** Miners earn inflation for supporting the network, developers hold the token hoping their efforts will raise its value, and users buy the token creating demand and pay transaction fees: it is a very simple and well-balanced ecosystem: **helping yourself, helps the system to thrive, and very often it doesn\u2019t even matter whether that system is useful or not.**\\n\\nWe are building the Future Of Giving and are fascinated by these mechanisms, we want to use these self-sustaining models for actual good. **The \u2018Commons\u2019** can be [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons) as \u201c\\\\[\u2026\\\\] resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage **for individual and collective benefit**.\u201d We, and many communities like ours, that are organized around social impact causes, are suffering from scarcity, because **we think about the collective benefit and ignore the individual,** who needs to survive as well; this is unsustainable. By default, people will actually do the opposite and take their individual interest over that of the common good, which is often called the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). In **both cases**, there is a major incentive alignment issue: either the individual gains but the collective suffers or the other way around. Witnessing for a while now these emerging, more sustainable systems, we believe it is time for the next step. By modeling the success of existing blockchain ecosystems (through the implementation of new cryptoeconomic primitives) we want **to create abundance to support the Commons**, thinking about both the collective as well as the individual interests.\\n\\nNow, our goal at Giveth is to use token engineering, more specifically, Curation Markets, to bring this from a purely digital realm, into the real world. We will build it on top of our Dapp, and **build it in such a way that it supports projects that benefit our common interest**, or in other words, that will enable us to sustainably crowdfund the Commons. The initial work was to enable transparent and accountable donations on the blockchain, the next step is to move away from \u2018donating\u2019 altogether and to create a sustainable system: **gifted funds become backed by a token of value in a circular economy.** As [Abbey Titcomb](https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c) says:\\n\\n> \u201cWe believe the answer to the underfunding of social goods and underserved community contribution is to reframe social goods as self-governing and continuously funded commons.\u201d\\n\\n**Wait but How?**\\n-----------------\\n\\nThrough building the augmented bonding curve model created by [BlockScience](https://block.science/) on top of our DApp we want to create continuously funded organizations. How does this work? We first learned about them through [a post](https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8) by [Jeff Emmett](https://twitter.com/jeffemmett), a Giveth collaborator, who explains the basic building blocks \u2014 a highly recommended read to learn more on how token bonding curves could enable a project to bootstrap funding and token value along with project success and popularity. You can find more references in Abbey Titcomb\u2019s report on [what we built at ETHDenver](https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c), and for all [technical definitions](https://medium.com/@michaelzargham/jargon-party-e3616cd16a9) and [more theory](https://medium.com/block-science/on-the-practice-of-token-engineering-part-i-c2cc2434e727), we refer you to [Michael Zargham](https://medium.com/@michaelzargham).\\n\\n\\nHowever, we would like to illustrate the theory now through a real life example of how this could work, imagining a future in which Giveth has already built this model into its DApp (also available [in video format, narrated by Griff Green](https://youtu.be/WJ23oQpooG0?t=694)):\\n\\nSo imagine you live by the beach, and you have the habit of picking up trash regularly, but you see this is just not having the impact you desire: it doesn\u2019t scale. For more impact you are also regularly donating to a nonprofit promising exactly this, large-scale impact but \u2026 all you see is a lot of marketing and a continuous request for more funds. This is all very frustrating.\\n\\nAt this point in time, you run into Jonathan, an activist who you often saw on the beach doing exactly what you do: cleaning up. He tells you about a new kid on the block: the \u2018TrashHeroes\u2019 and they are offering you something else. They invite you to not just give money but to actually help them steer the organization. In return for an amount you choose you will receive tokens, tokens that allow you to make decisions for the common good of the organization. On top of this, if you do a good job and the organization runs smoothly one day those tokens could be worth more than what you donated. This sounds too good to be true, but hey, you were donating funds anyways and with this one you get a say in the decisions!\\n\\nSo you give 10 xDAI ([a representation of DAI token](https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-partners-with-makerdao-on-xdai-chain-the-first-ever-usd-stable-blockchain-65a078c41e6a)) and receive TrashHero Tokens, which you hear actually have value, in the real world. **The value however, is not determined by an open market, but by a smart contract**, which is actually the token bonding curve. So how does this work you ask? The price, the value of the TrashHero Token, is determined by the total supply of the token in general: if more people mint the token in return for xDAI, the price of the TrashHero Token goes up. If the supply goes down \u2014 when people burn their tokens and take money out of the contract the price of the token goes down. **The big difference however with existing curve models, and which makes this one sustainable is two-fold.** First, there is **the curve itself** which disincentivizes people who get in late to burn their tokens quickly, they need to keep these for a while if they want to make a profit. The second element is that people who get in early should be the people who are in it for the long haul, because they are the believers in the cause, they will most often be the experts. This is stimulated by preventing our pioneers from burning their tokens immediately: **their tokens are locked until specific goals** (which we call Milestones in our DApp) have been reached. In this way the collective interests you are fighting for are protected by default, the Commons needs those funds and outweigh your short-term self-interest, and you are incentivized to reach the set goals, the Milestones. **This innovative system where everyone acts in their own self-interest, propels the Commons forward and pushes it to reach its set goals.**\\n\\n\\nBack to our TrashHeroes that have invited you to be part of this initial group of experts who together have raised quite some xDAI to initialize the curve and the TrashHero Commons. One half, 50% of this xDAI, is locked in the smart contract, 50% of this xDAI is given to a DAO controlled by the TrashHero token holders to execute on their common interest, now baptized the TrashHero Commons. **This Commons that supports the cause of cleaning up the beaches will now need to come up with good proposals to actually support this cause. As the Commons spends money, the tokens that were given to the group that initialized the curve will become unlocked periodically.** This spending goes through Milestones you help create in the Giveth DApp: xDAI will be released once the initiative takers (the \u2018Milestone Managers\u2019) prove they have actually reached the goals they set that support the Commons\u2019 cause (i.e. cleaning up beaches) \u2014 this is where the power of Giveth kicks in: **you only get rewarded when you are being accountable**.\\n\\nThe effective working of the TrashHero Commons is steered through a novel type of curation market governance system that allows you to use your TrashHero Tokens to signal priorities of tasks (Milestones) to be executed for the Commons to reach its goals. When a target that supports the goals of the Commons is proposed \u2014 for example, you get 15 friends together and make a Milestone for doing a side-by-side, step-by-step cleaning of 5 km of coast \u2014 and if it is supported by the TrashHero Token holders, it will receive funding from the Commons: xDAI will be sent to the Giveth Milestone. Then once the task has been completed, by documenting in pictures and videos the gathering of 3 tons of plastic and waste, the xDAI will be sent to the token bonding curve and you will be minted TrashHero Tokens, which you can then decide to burn immediately (without a need to speculate if you don\u2019t want to) to receive your xDAI. When you or anyone else decides to burn your tokens, there is a fee that goes back into the Commons, which is the lever that will support more social good. **To us, this is the Future of Giving**: your socially beneficial behavior creates a surplus!\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJ23oQpooG0\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n##### _Griff Green\u2019s talk at EthCC Paris on the evolutionary movement of human collaboration through blockchain (TrashHero Commons example starts at_ [_10:55_](https://youtu.be/WJ23oQpooG0?t=655)_)_\\n\\n**Generosity generates Income**\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nDoing good _feels_ good, and we hope our alternative economic system will attract more people who want to do good by not just giving but by staying involved. **Instead of just simply donating, they get the opportunity to participate in a circular economy that supports the underlying cause**. As more people will be encouraged to join the Commons, it incentivizes the people who initialized the curve to do even better, as the initial token holder\u2019s funds will only be unlocked as the community actually does good, and spends the money. **By being generous and by participating in good governance they can generate an actual financial return, an income \u2014 they create abundance.**\\n\\nNext to this, speculators will get involved, because that is what happens with tokens, and actually, its great! Secondary markets and the trading volume will hopefully create an extra flow of funds that isn\u2019t normally part of a charitable community. **After the initialization of the curve, the new donations create tokens that have no locking period, and 100% of those funds go straight into the bonding curve.** When later participants burn their tokens they however always pay a fee, and this fee goes back into the Commons, which further support its goals. Every participant \u2014 whether it is an initial crowdfunder, a regular Giver or a speculator \u2014 should and will act in their own self-interest, which is steering the Commons to become a success, with everyone\u2019s incentives aligned.\\n\\n\\n**One more important note: this is a giant experiment and it may not work.** However because of the use of the Giveth DApp the projects that are looking to clean up beaches, help the homeless or do research to cure Alzheimer are insulated from the governance experiment\u2019s failure. **The benefit is that these initiatives will exist on our Giveth DApp, so there are multiple ways to fund them.** If a token holder really wants a specific Giveth Milestone to be supported but the governance of the Commons breaks down for one reason or another, they can burn their token (again helping the economy through a small fee), receive xDAI, and send it directly to the specific Milestone on the DApp they wanted to support. The Commons is one actor in an open system. What we will have done is create an extra way to fund projects on our DApp and most probably generate quite some buzz around that specific economy, a buzz supported both by the community as well as by speculators. Whatever happens, more people will know that this cause needs to be supported.\\n\\n**We started Building this Future of Giving Yesterday**\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith every statement we make, new questions come up (for example [this dialogue in our chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!vwFGsktMNkdorFWJRi:matrix.org/$1552247327760014NjKKA:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=giveth.io&via=status.im)), and we do not have all the answers just yet. The models we use are however based on years of research by BlockScience, and are being refined and further documented by the team led by [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mzargham) with whom we are in a constant dialogue. To put this theory to the test, we wanted to build this yesterday, so that\u2019s what we are doing. With the very limited funds we have available, **we have decided to kickstart this project by addressing the wisdom and skills of the very core for whom we are building this: the Crowd, the Commons, You.** We will build and hack this together with you, and we have already started doing this successfully. At ETHDenver we supported the Pactful Team, where we won the Impact Track [by building a proof-of-concept user interface](https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c) for our idea. We continued at [EthParis](https://twitter.com/Givethio/status/1101583428506583040) and are **now ramping up to build various components that will all tie into a working whole during** [**Odyssey**](https://www.odyssey.org/) in the Netherlands, the biggest AI & Blockchain Hackathon in the world. We are the largest group participating and have been accepted with five teams, working on four of the hackathon\u2019s tracks gathering a multi-talented team of 30+ people. We are uniting developers from many different projects in the Ethereum space to form a Commons and help us build this Future of Giving, together.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GymkCSdm778\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n##### Abbey Titcomb with the Pactful Team, who won the Impact Track at ETHDenver\\n\\nMore is coming very soon but in the meantime you can **catch up** by watching Griff Green\u2019s [EthCC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ23oQpooG0&feature=youtu.be&t=20), read Abbey Titcomb\u2019s [ETHDenver update](https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c), scrutinize the [models at BlockScience](https://medium.com/block-science/on-the-practice-of-token-engineering-part-i-c2cc2434e727), and keep yourself up-to-date by following us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/givethio).

They aren\u2019t. Self-managed organizations exist all over the world, but there is no template for how a decentralized self-managed organization should work. Let us try to change that._\\n\\nSelf-managed organizations (those without a management middlemen layer and hierarchy) have to overcome a lot of hurdles when it comes to governance. For example, on one side, the direction of the organization cannot be dictated top-down by management and on the other side nobody can push responsibility up and \u201cjust do what they are told\u201d.\\n\\nThese hurdles, Frederic Laloux, author of \u201c[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)\u201d suggests, exist mainly because traditional management practices and traditionally managed organizations are so prevalent that we have a lack of examples to follow. In other words, we might have never seen better! Moreover, there have been years and years of organizational research and practice on hierarchical structures (think both about an old-age tribe with a clear, visible head and also a large corporation with a twitter rant-prone CEO).\\n\\nOn top of that, we have new models of governance arising within blockchain structures or enabled by blockchain solutions ([here\u2019s](https://medium.com/@leo_pold_b/blockchain-governance-takeaways-from-nine-projects-8a80ad214d15) a pretty good article that touches on some of the key points), although there is not so much literature on specifically non-hierarchical, egalitarian structures.\\n\\nWhile there are great companies pushing the envelope in both blockchain governance and self-management, it\u2019s time for us to investigate, explore and document different forms of non-hierarchical governance for organizations. Giveth\u2019s Governance Circle, and particularly [Loie](https://twitter.com/Loie_Low), whose goal is to foster governance experiments, is launching the Unicorn DAC on that regard. Lorelei devoted countless hours to ideate, iterate and bring to life this project with the rest of the Unicorns\u2026 and this is the result.\\n\\nStepping up the game\\n--------------------\\n\\nOperationally, Giveth works much like a swarm. Around a strong core of main contributors, collaborators that are aligned with the purpose of Giveth come and go and offer their time, ideas and work. Some of these collaborators do one assignment and leave and others stay collaborating on the periphery but for the longest time. They are rewarded through a mechanism called [RewardDAO](https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a), with which everyone can get points that then can be exchanged for ether if they upload a video on our [Wall of Fame](https://fame.giveth.io/) or to the [DApp itself](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3d9746329bc64ae74d1424).\\n\\nBut these points are awarded somewhat arbitrarily and there\u2019s a limited amount of monthly ether that goes to fund these rewards. Hence, the amount that collaborators receive in ether can vary depending on other people\u2019s contributions and points. We think it\u2019s a great introductory system for getting into the Giveth Galaxy, but might not be ideal as a fully decentralized non-hierarchical governance model. In fact, it\u2019s not really a complete governance model, as it doesn\u2019t necessarily steer Giveth\u2019s big decisions, but our experience tells us that it does motivate people to take initiative, talk to the most committed contributors and suggest new projects and initiatives.\\n\\n**Put your money where your purpose is**\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nTo be clear, governance in self-managed organizations boils down to who decides \u2014 and how it is decided \u2014 what the organization dedicates its resources to?\\n\\nSo in the case of Giveth, the question was: How could we empower everyone that is fully committed to Giveth to decide what actions and what strategic direction should the organization take? And even further, could we do that in a way that we leverage our own products, i.e. the Giveth DApp? -we do like our #dogfooding!\\n\\nWell, the Giveth DApp allows Makers to create [DACs, Campaigns and Milestones](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/), and Givers to fund whatever change they want to see realized in the world. Could we not create a DAC that Unicorns can use to propose projects through Milestones, and other Unicorns can fund them if they think they are aligned with Giveth\u2019s purpose? We would distribute money to our Unicorns \u2014 this group of core contributors \u2014 and they could fund any Milestone they wanted.\\n\\n> **What better way to steer an organization than by democratizing both the access to resources and the power to propose actions and then let everyone actually put resources where the Giveth purpose lies the strongest?**\\n\\nSometimes Unicorns will decide to fund already existing Milestones, and sometimes they will create a new bounty. This gives everyone the power to suggest a project, give it a price tag, and if the funding target gets reached, empower and pay this person to make it happen. If it doesn\u2019t get funded, it would mean that the project was possibly not so aligned with the general feeling and purpose anyway.\\n\\n**Examples of funded proposals:**\\n\\na) Lorelei is often frustrated by the lack of sharing info in the Ethereum community. Everybody seems to be having the same conversations but no one is hearing each other. When she hears about Tennagraph, the community signaling aggregator to answer just this need, she becomes very passionate about it and decides to use her Unicorn DAC delegation allowance to fund Deam to go to Web3 Summit and raise awareness and adoption for Tennagraph!\\n\\n\\nb) Lanski has identified a feature for our [DApp](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4) that a bunch of Makers would like to have in the platform. It might not seem it\u2019s a priority from a technical point of view, but as a matter of fact, all the feedback that he is receiving from the users mentions that particular need. He assesses the cost with the DApp team and creates a Milestone where they (the DApp team) are the beneficiary. The work, though, is too expensive and he cannot pay it on his own, but Lorelei realizes how important the feature is and funds the Milestone too so the DApp team can go ahead and build it to claim the Milestone.\\n\\n**Example of an unsuccessful proposal:**\\n\\nLanski wants to make stickers of Giveth\u2019s logo to stick all over the world \u2014 for marketing purposes. Everyone has got some stickers left from the last batch, but not enough to cover half of the world with them, so he wants to make MORE. But the general consensus is that we are publicizing well and doing the right outreach in the circles that we want to attract at this stage, so nobody actually funds the Milestone. Sorry Lanski, maybe later when we decide to do a publicity campaign for the general public!\\n\\n**Ins and outs of the Unicorn DAC**\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThis Governance experiment is precisely that, an experiment. And the initial parameters are sort of arbitrarily defined and will be polished as we go along.\\n\\n1.  We\u2019ve been a community gathered around shared principles and purpose for a while now, but never had an official onboarding process because there\u2019s no clear entity to be onboarded to. Now, we have the opportunity to come together around these agreements and create a membrane that gathers and recognizes the most committed of us as we join the Unicorn DAC. You can read about our Onboarding Process [here](https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/unicorn-dac/unicorn-onboarding/), which ensures commitment to Giveth\u2019s purpose and alignment with our principles in order to opt to be part of the DAC.\\n2.  The resource allowance per head will be the equivalent in ether to 600 USD every week. In order for people not to fund only their own Milestones, we have capped the amount people can put into their own Milestones at 150 USD, so 450 will be used to decide on other people\u2019s initiatives. Unicorns don\u2019t have to use the full 600 USD every week if they feel that there are no interesting projects to fund, or the ones that are truly interesting are already fully funded.\\n3.  Needless to say, people can choose NOT to fund any of their own Milestones. The reason why we allow people to self-fund their Milestones for a certain amount is to facilitate the funding of menial or uninteresting jobs that have to be done, but they would waste people\u2019s time and resources if they had to be reviewed and funded by other unicorns.\\n4.  We cannot expect people to feel connected to a purpose by only chipping money into Milestones. Hence, in order to keep purpose alive, we have a once a month Unicorn Meeting! Here, we discuss which projects we delegated to and why it is aligned to Giveth.\\n5.  As a rule of thumb, Milestones will be created by those who hold roles related to the matter at hand. That\u2019s not to say that people can\u2019t have great ideas outside of their roles, but they should follow the [advice process](https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/advice-process/) and certainly consult with those who hold relevant roles before taking action, even if it is merely for keeping information flows going. Roles are evaluated on how well they have been fulfilled in a peer review system every month.\\n\\n**MVPing our way through it**\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nWe are ready to try the Unicorn DAC and carve our own way in decentralized governance practices. As the experiment that it is, we do expect some issues to come up, and we have already identified a few:\\n\\n1.  [Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) is our motto because we believe the Giveth DApp is a great tool. Nevertheless, it does not yet have the advanced functionalities of a compounded delegation system that would allow you to allocate only up to a percentage of funds into your own Milestones and the rest to others. We will track donations manually at this point while we look for a solution, be it homemade or leveraging [Aragon](https://aragon.org/).\\n2.  Foreign influence. Our DAC will always be public, transparent and held to the highest standards, but the fact that it\u2019s an open way to fund the projects that Giveth undertakes, it could be exposed to an admittedly unlikely vector of attack where a powerful party decides to fund specific Milestones or projects that are on the periphery of the purpose and this acts in detriment of the best direction to take. This would be a similar attack to sovereignty to the [IMF dictating policies to countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893815001003) in exchange for bailouts or access to concessional loans.\\n3.  That said, we have funds to support this initiative for a limited period of time, and since Giveth is a non-profit blockchain entity that accepts donations, if you are a donor and **want to support Blockchain4Good projects PLUS a decentralized non-hierarchical governance experiment like the Unicorn DAC**, we are all ears (and eyes!): hit us up on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Givethio) or fund us [directly](https://giveth.io/donate/)!\\n\\n**Already winning**\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe Unicorn DAC was presented during DevCon4 at the [Aragon Dream DAO contest](https://blog.aragon.org/devcon4-recap/)\u2026 and it won the runner-up prize! 250 ANT + 250 DAI for making it a reality! Aragon and Giveth (and the Unicorn DAC in particular) share the basic principles of decentralization and non-hierarchicality. We see Aragon as the perfect tool to facilitate and enable this governance experiment.\\n\\nHave a look at Lorelei pitching at minute 58:15 below!\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewL9ZvFeaHU\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n#winning\\n\\n**But\u2026 why?**\\n-------------\\n\\nIt is worth reproducing a conversation I had with Lorelei on the reason to spend money and effort trying to devise and implement untested ways of governance:\\n\\n> \u201cIs it appropriate to answer this question with a meme?\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Santa Gives Unicorns\\" src={useBaseUrl(\\"img/blog/santaMemeUnicornDAC.jpeg\\")} />\\n\\n> Ha, but in all seriousness, the Unicorn DAC takes these decentralization experiments within. Any good mission reaches as far out into the world as it does into its creator, which in this case is us, the Ethereum community. We can yab about decentralization of power all day while at home we still have one or a privileged few making the influential calls on how money is spent, and this DAC offers a solution to that.\u201d\\n\\nWe are launching this experiment to change how the world looks at self-management. We believe there are more human ways to interact and organize than the rigid, sometimes alienating structures of today.\\n\\nCome join our dialog in our [Riot](http://join.giveth.io/) or share your ideas below \u2014 they will be read and discussed!

Gone are the days where you could work 30 years at a company, then get a fancy watch and a golden handshake into retirement. The industrial revolution of the early 1800\u2019s brought more people out of the country and into factories and workshops, attracted by better pay.\\n\\nAnd while offices were growing in number back then, it wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that office culture became a mainstream phenomenon. Now with the arrival of the internet and, more recently, blockchain we are seeing another shift in the way people work.\\n\\nAt [**The Bounties Network**](https://medium.com/bounties-network) and [**Giveth Social Coding**](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org) we decided to collaborate on this topic. So we recently posed and posted a question about The Future of Work:\\n\\n> _\u201cIf you love your employees let them go, to Thailand, to school, to a sabbatical where ever they might choose. The constraints placed on us today in the working economy are unreasonable and completely unconducive to personal growth, truth, happiness and workplace fulfilment.\u201d_\\n\\nToday we\u2019re going to integrate some of the responses from [**that post**](https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/1641) to get a better idea of how the future of work may look like.\\n\\nLocation, Location, Location\\n============================\\n\\nThe company of the future is no longer bound by company walls or even country borders for that matter. Employers are starting to understand that sourcing the best talent at the right price is more important than where they are located. Poster **Jose Aguinaga** highlights this about his international company:\\n\\n> _In our company, we are roughly 15+ employees/designers all over the world. We have people from Mexico City to New Zealand, in Vancouver and Sofia. We started in Switzerland, and have embraced a decentralized workspace from day 1._\\n\\n\\nMany jobs these days only require a laptop and a good internet connection\\n\\nThe internet ushered in the digital economy and a huge percentage of job postings these days are looking for digital skills. The obvious benefit of this is that you can work remotely just about anywhere you have a computer and a decent internet connection.\\n\\nJose goes on to explain, however, that remote working is not for everybody. It requires discipline, flexibility, and a sense of responsibility that may not suit everyone\u2019s personality. Some workers are just not cut out for that kind of independence. To be clear, many jobs still require us to be in the same space. But in the future, we will be able to solve many of the problems that come with trying to cram so many people into big cities.\\n\\nWorking in Tune with Your Own Rhythms\\n=====================================\\n\\nLet\u2019s expand on that a bit. As many of you will know, working a 9\u20135 job in a major city can be a real headache. With worldwide populations continuing to grow, it\u2019s not unheard of to hear people spend 2\u20133 hours every day commuting to work. But now many companies are starting to wake up to the fact that many tasks are not time-specific. Do you really need to be in the office at 9 to respond to client emails for an hour?\\n\\nIn addition, employees are not robots (most anyway) and do not function with on/off switches. Every worker is unique and possesses strengths and weaknesses. People produce their best work at various times of the day. User **Brad** highlighted this in his post with the following words:\\n\\n> _It has been repeatedly shown that creative and intelligent minds are more likely to be night owls, and unlikely to stay tied down to one place for long periods of time._\\n\\nNow whether or not that fits your profile is irrelevant. Some people love the early morning hours and take the afternoon off. Some work perfectly in the 9\u20135 structure. Others, as Brad suggests, work well into the night when the peace and quiet provide plenty of opportunities to get work done.\\n\\nTo add to that, most workers would agree that one of the most important aspects of a job is a healthy working environment. Happy employees are productive workers. Poster **Bount\\\\_Hunter** highlights this well in his/her post:\\n\\n> _If the person you want to do X job for you is happier to be doing it a 8pm -4 am in Malaysia vs 9\u20135 in chicago their work will always be better. We\u2019ve all worked jobs we HATE (i\u2019m currently doing that now) and you don\u2019t get the best work from people who are working jobs they don\u2019t like._\\n\\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations\\n======================================\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise then that decentralized organizations are springing up everywhere. And blockchain is pioneering this effort with projects dedicated to making that kind of a future a reality. Take [**Aragon**](https://aragon.org/) for example, a project aimed at breaking down traditional borders and intermediaries.\\n\\nIn the modern world, much of the existing business value is captured by those at the top of the pyramid. It\u2019s a little sad then that many of the people creating that value don\u2019t actually get rewarded for doing so. The workplace of tomorrow will flatten these management structures and allow the value to be distributed more evenly.\\n\\nTake this very article for example. It was crowd-sourced and funded from contributors around the world using a decentralized application. What could be more empowering than allowing employees to have an active stake and say in the company and process from the get-go?\\n\\nClosing Thoughts: The Future of Work\\n====================================\\n\\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to see a change in the future of work since we\u2019ve been following a centralized hierarchical office model for many years now. The only thing we can be certain of is change. Those that embrace it are usually the ones who reap the most rewards in the new economy.\\n\\nFinally, to highlight the real-life change we are facing as work evolves, let me tell you a little about my own history. I am a South African who is dating a German who lives in the Netherlands. My mother is Italian and I work part-time for an American company. Borders are completely artificial constructions of man. The human spirit doesn\u2019t want to be tied down by the rules of a few men sitting in an office somewhere. The future of work is exciting. The future of work is decentralized.\\n\\nAre you ready to join us in the distributed work space? Head on over to [**The Bounties Network**](https://explorer.bounties.network/) and say hello.

What are some of the crazy things we believe in? After working with the team for +7 months now (which is years in blockchain time) these are some of the thoughts that come to mind\u2026_**\\n\\nWe are a Community\\n------------------\\n\\n> What we are doing is not about the technology. Most of us are very, very tech-minded and geeky people, and we love tech, but that is not what it is about or why we are here. It is about the people, the human connection.\\n>\\n> We live in a world that has never been more connected, but never have we felt more isolated, never have our individualistic traits and our ego been more nurtured (think social media, for one) than today. But has it made us happier? Definitely not. Even worse, it has made us retreat into ourselves, giving less, both emotionally as well as financially. Giveth wants to turn the tide, bring back the connection by building/buidling and making the World a Better Place.\\n>\\n> We are not an organization, not a DAO, we strive to be more, we are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (a DAC). Communities are based on shared values and this is what corporations and organizations lack. They do pretend to have core values, but these are outward facing, top-down and are used for branding purposes. Our values are bottom-up, crowdsourced and are the higher good that connects us.\\n>\\n> We are a community of individuals and we celebrate and respect each and everyone\u2019s uniqueness.\\n\\nWe dare to be Vulnerable\\n------------------------\\n\\n> Our main value, our essence lies in vulnerability. Most of the people at Giveth, and even in the wider \u2018Maker\u2019 blockchain space (=the opposite of daytrader land) are here because they know what ego and image brings to the world. They are professionals who have lived the corporate life and knew something was \u2018off\u2019. Hierarchy and image boosting bring pain, misunderstanding and most of all a huge waste of time and loads of inefficiency.\\n>\\n> When you dare to be vulnerable - even fragile, open and true - you can make lasting changes, because it\u2019s the only way to truly connect with another human being. And together, when you connect, you always achieve more.\\n>\\n> Another crucial reason to open up is because \u2018the system\u2019 has trained us to be numb by providing us with all possible tools (binge-watching, medication, social media, shopping, \u2026 the list is endless). We have been trained to care less, to be less conscious of suffering and injustice, during a time where we are actually hyper-connected and thus can be hyper-informed. Knowledge brings power: sharing your thoughts, ideas and feelings can change the world. We just have to express our **outrage** and team up, because right now, as individuals, together, we actually have a bigger impact than ever before in the history of mankind.\\n\\n(Please watch [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM) if you never have before)\\n\\nWe are Inclusive\\n----------------\\n\\n> Everyone is welcome, we are huggers. We believe everyone has talents, has skills and can contribute to Making the World a Better Place. If you see a need in our community you should come over and get it done (see \u2018We are Makers\u2019). But even if you just want to lurk around, you should, even just you being there inspires us and we hope to inspire you.\\n>\\n> We believe in equal rights, even more, this is a given, this is no topic of discussion. No matter what gender, race, religion or political philosophy you adhere to: you are welcome, and you will be loved. Because giveth is all about community.\\n\\nWe advocate Abundance\\n---------------------\\n\\n> When there is abundance people shine. Abundance is the opposite of fear and scarcity, the things that make people become protective and close-minded. We want to give people the chance to develop themselves. We want to be a spark of light, a pulsing star in this galaxy, an inspiration to others, an energy that rubs off.\\n>\\n> Only if we harness this internal energy we will be able to make real and lasting change in this world. When there is abundance people thrive and are able to not only show off their skills but their talents. The difference between skills and talents is that you no longer only do what you are good at, you do what brings happiness into your life and you bring this into the lives of others.\\n\\nWe are striving to be fully Decentralized\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n> Money is not evil. Neither are people. But centralized power is. We are all equal with our differences. Blockchain technology, which is by its nature decentralized, is a driving force that builds and inspires our language. Language brings Culture and Culture will bring lasting change, an entirely different way to approach tensions, a new angle to think about \u2018issues\u2019.\\n>\\n> We are about the people. But we are not about just one person or a few stars, we are a Galaxy and all of us should burn brightly.\\n\\nWe are Humble\\n-------------\\n\\n> You cannot be decentralized and part of a Community if you do not let go of your ego. We don\u2019t boast. We are not interested in your words but in what you do. We let our work speak for itself and will celebrate the individuals, but most of all the community that makes dreams a reality.\\n>\\n> We like to have fun but we celebrate balance and modesty. When it comes to spending, we are transparent and accountable because it makes things easier and just, well\u2026 more honest.\\n\\nWe are Transparent\\n------------------\\n\\n> Sharing is caring. We have nothing to hide. We are fully transparent, we practise what we preach, we are open-source.\\n>\\n> We communicate as much as possible, also between us, we do not hold back. We convey our tensions and our desired outcomes, but always try to do this in a very respectful way.\\n\\nWe are Makers\\n-------------\\n\\n> When we see something needs to be done, we do it. As Swarm City [would say](https://press.swarm.city/niks-moet-2fd1b7682bb8), \u201cthe person who spots a problem is likely the most suited to solve it, because it is their brain that is attuned to seeing the gap between what is now, and what might be.\u201d We don\u2019t endlessly discuss things, this is just negative energy.\\n>\\n> Do not underestimate us. Our values might sound \u2018out there\u2019, idealistic or naive. But we are not. We underpromise and overdeliver. We are professionals, with lots of experience. We are engineers, developers, professional marketeers, business owners, \u2026 and we are here to stay.\\n\\n\\n> ~[Kris Decoodt](https://medium.com/u/f56581bbe1a7?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------)\\n\\n\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\\n\\n**Giveth is constantly evolving and so should this document, in no way should we expect any document to totally encompass what it is to be a part of the Giveth community.

Some of us dream of traveling to far off places and delivering cold, clean drinking water to those who are thirsty. Some imagine providing housing for the ever-growing homeless and refugee populations worldwide. Others picture themselves developing a small plot of land for inner-city children to learn about gardening. Whether global or local, big or small, many of us truly want to help others.\\n>\\n> But how do we actually help? How do we go about making a real impact?\\n>\\n> If we have money available to donate to people in need, we soon discover the seemingly infinite layers of vampiric bureaucracy between our donations and the intended recipients, massively decreasing our intended impact.\\n>\\n> If we have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, we\u2019re soon disillusioned by the major inefficiencies, lack of training and organization, misallocation of resources, and other issues that exist within hierarchically managed systems.\\n>\\n> If we have willpower and like-minded individuals and we decide to initiate our own causes, we quickly encounter regulatory roadblocks and resistance from archaic systems of centralized power, diverting our focus away from doing good and toward filling out paperwork and paying fees, if we\u2019re allowed to proceed at all.\\n>\\n> We exhaust ourselves trying to do good through traditional channels, and the question still remains: how do we actually help? How do we go about making a real impact?\\n>\\n> When the systems available to us are inherently flawed, we stop relying upon those systems to achieve our goals. With tools and technologies hitherto nonexistent, we instead build a new platform for giving for the future.\\n>\\n> The desire to make the world a better place hasn\u2019t changed, but the tools available to do so have. At the intersection of this drive to do good and the opportunities opened up to us through blockchain technology and decentralized governance, you\u2019ll find a group of individuals known as Unicorns. These Unicorns are all a part of a growing, global community dedicated to changing the way we give. This decentralized altruistic community is known as Giveth.\\n>\\n> Like the Unicorns who make up Giveth, Giveth is diverse and ever-growing.\\n\\n*   Giveth is both a culture and a manifestation of intent.\\n*   Giveth is an expression of love and the result of action and hard work.\\n*   Giveth is a transparent proof of decentralized governance in action.\\n*   Giveth is an amalgamation of altruism and the adjacent possible.\\n*   Giveth is a global community and a gift to the world.\\n*   Giveth is open, welcoming, and ready to support you in making the world a better place.\\n\\n> If you have money available to donate to people in need, you can watch its transmittance across the world on an open ledger to assure it actually gets to those who need it. With the tools and technologies available to us, there\u2019s no more bureaucracy to siphon off funds along the way to the recipients. Giveth doesn\u2019t even take a cut \u2014 it doesn\u2019t need to \u2014 it\u2019s funded through the same process as the project you just donated to.\\n>\\n> If you have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, you\u2019ll find the Giveth platform maximizes the efficiency and impact of the work you do with clearly defined milestones and the minimal number of actors needed to accomplish the goal. Transparency and accountability are built in, so your work is both noticed and supported by your fellow Unicorns as well as the donors themselves.\\n>\\n> If you have willpower and like-minded individuals and you decide to initiate your own causes, you\u2019ll discover an easy-to-use toolset that enables you to create a project with the same ease as creating a blog post. You\u2019ll immediately be able to start receiving donations and create clear steps to achieving your ultimate outcome with no red-tape or fees of any kind.\\n>\\n> The best part about Giveth is that anybody can join the community and contribute to making the world a better place. If you\u2019re a human being living on planet Earth and you want to do good, we are your people, and this is your opportunity to make a real impact. Make your mark and add your name to the growing community of Unicorns from around the world by joining us on this magnificent journey to building the future of giving!\\n>\\n> **With A Love That Echoes Throughout The Galaxy**\\n\\n\\n> **_~_**[**_Joshua Du Chene_**](https://medium.com/u/b60aa9f7ce4d?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------)\\n\\n\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\\n\\nThe life of the Giveth Unicorn\\n==============================\\n\\n> Giveth Unicorns may come and go.

At its core Giveth enables communities to form around the causes that matter to them the most. On a personal level Giveth is the reason I shifted my vision from only seeing fungible stores of value loosely referred to as \u2018crypto\u2019 and decided to dedicate my corporeal energy to enabling trust within this space. A bit about me is in order first however.\\n>\\n> I came to \u2018crypto\u2019 not as a newbie but someone who was well versed in utilizing cryptographic hashes and technology within daily operations. My first introduction to personal computers came in 1986 when my family moved to Houston TX, and I would play games like \u2018Wheel of Fortune\u2019 , \u2018Ninja Gaiden\u2019, and \u2018SpiderMan\u2019 on our IBM 8086. My first tech job came at the age of 17 where I taught children QBASIC, html, and audio processing at the \u2018American Computer Experience\u2019 summer camps. Fast forward to 2009 and my technolust was immediately sparked by this thing I caught wind of called Bitcoin. I had no position in the market other than watching the price of BTC go from near nothing to over $10 USD/BTC.\\n>\\n> In August of 2017 life dealt me two perspective altering situations within a week: Hurricane Harvey and losing my job as a Corporate Security Analyst of 5 years. The loss of my position was heartbreaking but being surrounded by constant destruction brought on by an \u201c800 year flood\u201d kept me sane and sober. By December life had begun to return back to normal for most of us Houstonian\u2019s, however something incredible was taking place with the price of Bitcoin: it was over $10,000/BTC!\\n>\\n> The dramatic increase of volume plus pricing momentum within Bitcoin caused me to study value theory and seriously contemplate just wtf was going on. Whether it was serendipity, fate, or just plain dumb luck I discovered Giveth via a [youtube presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShzx6iqwus&index=15&list=PLIR2KLUqBsWnbhDZKi0S43Q5PnxFGdiEo) from Griff Green at the Ethereum Community Conference 2018. At this point all of my attention shifted studying pricing and volatility to determining how to best distribute trust.\\n>\\n> Giveth will play a key role in enabling communities to distribute trust via decentralized governance. At a high level, Giveth can be viewed as software that enables communities to form causes and promote those causes via group determined milestones. Individuals who are part of a given community can spawn their own milestones, and via pledging of ETH to those milestones prioritize what is and is not important for that community with 100% transparency. Additionally those who give within this structure can be notified when their milestone is reached as well as delegate authority of their contribution to others within their community.\\n>\\n> Giveth is not an ICO, a corporation, or a monolithic organization that promises to render aid while capturing the majority of users contributions in times of need (most charities). Giveth is an opportunity to do better by humanity via distributed trust within systems of decentralized governance that \\\\*anyone\\\\* can run.\\n\\n\\n> **_~_**[**_Meefs_**](https://medium.com/u/40f75102c422?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------)\\n\\n\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\\n\\n> ~DAppLion\\n\\n\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\\n\\n**Why Giveth?**\\n\\n> We believe in the power of communities to solve problems.\\n>\\n> We believe in decentralized technology to unleash the creativity and energy of altruistic communities.\\n>\\n> Giving is a humanitarian act of solidarity and empathy \u2014 we believe in the fundamental rights and dignity of every human being.\\n>\\n> We are doing nothing less than reinventing giving!\\n\\n**What?**\\n\\n> We build a platform for trust and transparency in giving.\\n>\\n> Decentralized altruistic communities promote social innovation and create opportunities for people.\\n>\\n> This platform is in strong contrast to the systems currently in place: bureaucratic, inflexible, centralized, with a lot of overhead\\n\\n**How?**\\n\\n> We are enthusiastic and passionate \u2014 we do a hell of a lot of amazing stuff.\\n>\\n> We are a community \u2014 open, transparent, cooperative, companionable and focused to deliver.\\n>\\n> We are an active part of the Ethereum eco-system and contribute to the development of Ethereum.\\n\\n\\n\\n> **_~Ron Mat_**\\n\\n\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\u26f5\ufe0f\\n\\n> **\u201cYou can\u2019t go around building a better world for people. Only people can build a better world. Otherwise it\u2019s just a cage.\u201d \u2014 Terry Pratchett**\\n\\n> If you want to understand what Giveth values are and what it means to be a Unicorn and to be part of the Giveth community, you has to understand that the simple goal of all Unicorns in the Giveth galaxy, all around the world is, to make the world a better place.\\n>\\n> This starts with the fact that Giveth trusts in people, real, actual people.\\n>\\n> Let me explain why this is an amazing, outstanding fact in 2018. We spend the last years and maybe generation with the trust in the big systems and cooperations. The (centralized) banking system, centralized political systems with so called \u201crepresentatives of the people\u201d who rule countries and do not even know any longer what is going on in a country, the idea that the fact that we are allowed to go to vote every 4 (or 5 years) is all it needs for a democracy to work. We trusted in this centralized systems to rule the world and sort out our human problems. What we end up with was a banking crisis, plastic rubbish all over the planet, a so called refugee crisis and more and more the distrust in systems. We trust in charity organizations all over the world to sort out what we humans fucked up in the past and wonder in the end that we do not know what happened with the donations that we made. We trusted in system for a long time, until we realized that this systems are not working out the way we wanted. We realized that no one will sort out all the rubbish in the oceans and at the beaches if we do not start doing it ourselves, more and more people realize that we need to take our power as citizens back to actually have a say in a democracy, we start to realize that it makes sense to have a reliable person we can trust instead of a bank. We start to realize that centralized systems do not work out the way we though. Decentralization and the trust in people, actually people are two of the main values of Giveth. All these people, all over the world, who contribute their love and time, their work and ideas into Giveth are Unicorns. People with ideas who want to be part of the movement to change the world and make it a better place are Unicorns.\\n>\\n> Giveth wants to give power back to people while decentralizing systems. One of Giveths goals and values is to make a donation system transparent, complete and absolute. We want to make donations transparent, direct and reliable. And even if Giveth is a charity organization, we are not just talking about donations. We are talking about the structure of governance within the organization, about reliable, accountable people within the Giveth galaxy, about the fact that everyone and anyone can actively participate in the platform, the organization and the idea of Giveth. The future of giving is not just giving ether to a cause that needs support. Giving can of course be monetary but can also be work force, bodys, love, time, minds and ideas for the greater good.\\n>\\n> A lot of people already volunteer for a good cause, give time and love to a project or an idea. Giveth is on the way to build a platform that allows any one of us to make a real change in our community, our neighborhood. I will be able to put up a cause that is important in my direct neighborhood and will make a change and a direct impact in my community \u2014 and you can too. Because, you not what? No one knows better what\u2019s going on in your neighborhood than you. Why should anyone donate money to a big, intransparent organization that pays CEO\u2019s instead of directly to your cause? Your community wants to teach kids how to code, you want to feed the homeless people, you want to gather a couple of people and pick up all the rubbish at your local beach/town/park? Cool, put up a cause on the Giveth platform and start to do so. Giveth believes and trusts in people and in you. This is the highest value any organization can have: the trust in people.\\n>\\n> Shaping the future needs more than just a couple of people, it needs all of us, the human community. So we are calling everyone, to become a Unicorn and join us in the movement to #maketheworldabtterplace.\\n\\n\\n\\n> **_~_** [**_jen Giveth_**](https://medium.com/u/7d328be176a3?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------)\\n\\n\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\ud83d\ude8c\\n\\n> _\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,_ [_we were all going direct the other way\u201d_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities)\\n\\n**_\u2013_ in short the Unicorns were getting easier and easier to spot as they were coming together to reinvent the most fundamental thing there is.**\\n\\n> **Giveth is reinventing what it means to be human.**\\n>\\n> Humans are not the only life form which create but we have made it our ultimate evolutionary skill. To create is to give and vice versa. Giving is the most primal expression of creating, the most basic level. To voluntarily give something that is yours ( mind, body, property\u2026) by leaving your ownership it becomes something for somebody else. In other words : something changed, transformed, got created.\\n>\\n> So giving, What\u2019s so special about that? Everybody does it in one way or another. But the giving the Unicorns are talking about is voluntarily or coercion-free! This means no one can force you in any way. Nor are there gatekeepers who have the power to interfere in the process of you giving. The Giveth Unicorns credo is very clear :\\n>\\n> \u2022 Donating can be simple, fun and effective.\\n>\\n> \u2022 Transparency and accountability can be the default.\\n>\\n> \u2022 Every idea has the potential to make a positive impact, and it can be heard and funded in a decentralized fashion.\\n>\\n> \u2022 Every Donor can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.\\n>\\n> \u2022 People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.\\n>\\n> \u2022 Real change and innovation comes about when communities join together to make the world a better place.\\n>\\n> Unicorns have always been elusive creatures but now the stars in the Giveth Galaxy have aligned and they are popping up everywhere. Everywhere people are noticing what is being built, being reinvented and want to contribute. The moment you give your time, your energy, your love to this community and project, and help in some way in its existence, a new Unicorn is born.\\n>\\n> Permissionless creation will make us unstoppable. It gives hope for the future and the confidence that there will always be people who act for the good of others and that they will succeed.\\n\\n\\n> **_~Xilef_**\\n\\n\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\\n\\n> There are restrictive walls that contain possibility. Inside these walls passion and motivation are strangled by bureaucracy, limitations, and unrelated political tethers.

Giveth is where possibility meets capacity, where, passion and motivation are free to flourish and where only nature itself can restrain us.\\n>\\n> Those with the passion to change the world sit on one side of a vast and long continent, on the other side are those who want to help them and have the resources to make their vision possible.

With transparency at the height of their values, however, they are just as easily looked past as they are open with their ability to share and positively impact their world. Hiding in the plain sight of the blockchain forests, these Unicorns believe in a simplicity that allow the moving parts of the world they believe in to glide seamlessly together without the need of a centralized force to guide them. They hope to give the power over sharing and donation out to the very people participating in order to stimulate a positive change of attitude and integrity for the **Decentralized Altruistic Communities** that they are a part of. By using this value system based on participation, innovation, transparency, and accountability the Giveth Unicorns hope to use smart contracts to put donors in charge of how their funds are used, they hope to allow that direct relationship to create a rewarding system for all who are involved so that positivity is felt at the very core of each donation. Giveth Unicorns know that sharing should feel good and that goodness has the ability to shift attitudes of the world for the better, for a more common force toward one another acting accountable and responsible for what they are putting out into the place we\u2019re all a part of.\\n\\n\\n\\n> **_~Zak Perna_**\\n\\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\\n\\n> Dear Galaxy,\\n>\\n> If you\u2019re reading this we\u2019ve done it, all the work the Unicorn troopers fought for was not in vain.\\n>\\n> **The mission we set out to accomplish was clear:**\\n>\\n> _Create a trustless system of self governing bodies, capable of uniting around causes they choose to support._\\n>\\n> _Build a platform that fosters experimentation, collaboration and open source initiatives._\\n>\\n> _Awaken the Giver within all the citizen of this Galaxy and beyond, by showing them how and where their contributions make a difference._\\n>\\n> The Centralization forces were determined to keep the Galaxy under their control, well we couldn\u2019t let that happen, not for our sake and the sake of generations to come.\\n>\\n> To accomplish our mission we had to do something greater than simply unseating the unjust forces.\\n>\\n> We had to show them a better way!\\n>\\n> **The way of the Unicorn.**\\n>\\n> We started a battle that will never end, the fight for truth, justice and transparency between citizens and powers is one that must live on forever.\\n>\\n> It\u2019s up to you to keep this fight alive all throughout your Galaxy, to inspire, incite and expose the truth for all to see.\\n>\\n> This was the cause we chose to fight for, the one we believed mattered most to our generation.\\n>\\n> Now it\u2019s your turn to decide, what will you fight for?\\n>\\n> We\u2019ve given you the tools to sculpt your future, to build your community and free yourselves.\\n>\\n> Use them wisely and never, EVER\u2026\u2026 **Forget!**\\n>\\n> **The way of the** [**Unicorn**](https://twitter.com/YalorMewn/status/992864729407291392) ( \u0361o \u035c\u0296 \u0361o)\\n\\n\\n\\n> **_~_**[**_Yalor Tackson_**](https://medium.com/u/33144025168f?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------)\\n\\n\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf17\ud83c\udf18\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12\ud83c\udf13\ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf17\ud83c\udf18\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12\ud83c\udf13\ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf17\ud83c\udf18\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12\ud83c\udf13\ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf17\\n\\n> Giveth is a global community focused on improving the world through blockchain technology.\\n>\\n> Trustless systems like a distributed ledger allow us to eliminate the middle man, cut down costs and provide transparency and accountability.

Not only this, but it is also accused of its employees exchanging aid for sexual favours, plain and simple sexual abuse. The case has opened the door for a cry of the nonprofit sector to uncover and denounce these practises, which seem to be [more common than one would think](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2018/feb/14/oxfam-allegations-are-tip-of-iceberg-sexual-harassment-and-aid-workers-podcast).\\n\\nTransparency and accountability in charitable donations have been put in check after the scandal broke out, with the International Development Secretary of the UK announcing a big audit of the organizations funded by public money, under [threat of cutting the funding](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-sexual-abuse-aid-workers-haiti-prostitutes-scandal-national-crime-agency-mordaunt-latest-a8211211.html) if their standards are not met. Presumably, such an audit will be expensive and will not bring much to light, as the system is fundamentally opaque, spending more taxpayers\u2019 money that could be dedicated to social impact projects.\\n\\nDespite some challenges, I genuinely believe that almost every person working in the development sector is in it to help other people and that they do the best they can. Until now, we didn\u2019t have tools that allowed for a different governance and management of large amounts of aid funds\u2026 but now we do.\\n\\nCampaign-based giving\\n=====================\\n\\nNowadays, one gives money to an organization and must trust them to use it properly. The money is given a priori, being a grant from the government, from a granting organization or from individuals. Once the money is in their bank account, it\u2019s -by design of how the banking system works- opaque to external people: we must trust them again to have proper procedures in place to avoid mismanagement of such funds i.e. [\u201cCaligula orgy with prostitutes in Oxfam T-shirts\u201d](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oxfam-in-haiti-it-was-like-a-caligula-orgy-with-prostitutes-in-oxfam-t-shirts-p32wlk0rp).\\n\\nWith [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) you will be able to see how the project is laid out, [Milestone by Milestone](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4), and how much money is required for each and every part. If a Milestone is not achieved, or the Milestone Reviewers (more on this category of validators shortly) perceive misconduct, 1) this Milestone will not be approved and paid out and 2) the Reviewer can decide to send all of the unspent funds back to the original Givers to be donated to other projects.\\n\\nThe most common issue raised here is: what happens if the Milestone Reviewer(s) is/are \u2018greased\u2019 by the Milestone Manager to approve an underachieved Milestone or to turn a blind eye on inappropriate behaviour? I see this as an excellent opportunity to bring together agents that have no special interest in colluding: a grassroots organization, the local community leadership, the government and an independent observer. One could decide that all of these need to agree on the validation and submit proof, similar to the videos used in Giveth\u2019s [RewardDAO](https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a). Technically, since the figure of the Reviewer is just an Ethereum address, it can be a contract, it could be a multisig wallet held by these relevant stakeholders. Another, if slightly more complex, setup is that a percentage of all Givers to a Campaign need to approve the Milestone after reviewing proof. Using a [Liquid Democracy](https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52) governance system here would naturally concentrate voting power in people that are reputable and are perceived to be neutral in this particular Campaign or even Milestone.\\n\\nI see this as a side benefit of Giveth\u2019s Campaigns: the need to be in constant communication with Milestone Reviewers and Campaign Managers creates \u2014 apart from transparency \u2014 a true Community where problems are openly discussed and input comes from all sides, because everyone has stake in the game.\\n\\nCommunities solving problems\\n============================\\n\\nThinking of the bigger picture, how can we really shake the giving \u2018industry\u2019 awake? Without questioning the expertise and indubitable economies of scale and know-how transfer of the big International NGOs, Giveth enables another sort of organization: The DAC, the [Decentralized Altruistic Community](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4). Can we do better than just trust Oxfam (or any equivalent INGO) to drop out of the air and deploy their tactics? The Giveth platform can be used for validation of Campaigns and Milestones, but \u2026 maybe we could go a step further.\\n\\nImagine the creation of a true DAC in Haiti, conformed by Givers, people on the ground (the \u2018Makers\u2019) and even representation of the INGOs, all communicating with each other and through an agreed form of governance that works to pledge resources the right way. This way we can make sure that Oxfam\u2019s expertise is allocated where it can impact the most, in constant communication with other stakeholders and with fully transparent decision making.\\n\\nYou get some decision power, you get some more, and you get some too!\\n=====================================================================\\n\\nDoes it sound complicated? After all, you are not an expert in Haiti\u2026 maybe you\u2019ve never even been there! How are you supposed to choose where to pledge funds or to know which Campaigns are going to be the most impactful? Giveth has got you covered. With Liquid Pledging, a concept derived from [liquid democracy](https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52), you can delegate the choice of your donations to Communities you perceive as experts: this can be an influential development group \u2014 Oxfam if you really must!- but also your former roommate\u2019s social impact group, which was really into this \u2018making a better world\u2019 thing. You delegate to a DAC, and it can send your donation to its chosen Campaign, a lot like how charity is supposed to work nowadays, but with much more oversight. You will be able to track your donation, veto any decisions the delegates make and get connected to the people/communities running the Campaigns you will be funding.\\n\\nOnce you start down the rabbit hole, the possibilities are endless: You can delegate half of your pledged funds to a DAC specializing in disaster relief, which in turn will fund some trusted Campaigns for smaller specific problems. The other half you can delegate to your favourite Campaign focusing on improving education in your hometown or even to another DAC that brings together all education projects in your area. Be as local or global as you want!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Liquid pledging at work\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/liquidPledging.png\')} />\\n\\n##### Liquid pledging at work\\n\\nHelp us solve the challenges\\n============================\\n\\nThe future is near. But not quite here yet, as this is not happening now. The main challenges are\\n\\n*   Scalablity of the crypto ecosystem. Let\u2019s face it, maybe we are not quite there yet. And I am not even speaking of unpredictable transaction fees raising the cost of donating and transactions not going through: Liquid Pledging is a complicated system that requires a lot of gas. Luckily [Giveth has a good stop-gap solution](https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060).\\n\\n> _If you are a Dev and/or working on scalability solutions, have a look at what ScalingNOW is doing_ [_here_](https://medium.com/giveth/scalingnow-bridge-chains-parity-8c359aca2b01) _and join us in building the future of Ethereum!_\\n\\n*   Liquid pledging would benefit greatly from some sort of identity on the blockchain, integrated with [governance tools like AragonOS](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae). The UI/UX for most of these applications remains outside of the control of most individuals, let alone organizations in the humanitarian sector who shouldn\u2019t have to focus on the technical side and should be able to interface seamlessly with the platform(s).\\n\\n> _Our Social Coding circle pushes Open Source projects like BrightID for Proof-of-Identity and other great projects.

How do you deal with international crypto transfers and especially the conversion of ETH (or whatever cryptocurrency Campaigns receive as donations) to fiat in order to pay for the expenses of the Campaigns?\\n\\n> _If you are working on projects that are building solutions for the last mile, please get in touch!_\\n\\n*   There are also many unanswered questions around taxation for the organizations deploying the Campaigns. They are receiving donations in crypto currencies and how this is to be treated is not well defined for taxation in most jurisdictions right now.\\n\\n> _If you are a lawyer and/or have good resources on the regulatory aspect, please hit me up or leave them in the comments!_\\n\\n[Join our community](http://join.giveth.io/): by tackling interesting problems like this one you can help us positively impact charitable giving forever!\\n\\n*   Find us on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org) or [Slack](http://slack.giveth.io/)\\n*   Discover our [Site](http://giveth.io/) and [Wiki](https://wiki.giveth.io/)\\n*   Fork our code on [Github](http://github.com/Giveth/)\\n*   Follow us on [Medium](http://medium.com/giveth/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/givethio), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/givethio) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/)\\n\\nHelp us Build the Future of Giving: \ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffc [Donate directly](http://donate.giveth.io/) \ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffc or buy a Ledger with our [affiliate link](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s?utm_source=&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=d663) \u23ce\\n\\nWritten by [Pol,](https://steemit.com/@pol-lanski) lovingly edited by [Griff](http://twitter.com/thegrifft) and [Kris](http://twitter.com/krrisis)"},{"id":"liquidDemocracy","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/liquidDemocracy","source":"@site/blog/2018-01-12-liquidDemocracy.md","title":"Liquid Democracy\u2026What That?!?","description":"Welcome to the future of voting.","date":"2018-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"12 de enero de 2018","tags":[],"readingTime":3.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Yalor","imageURL":"/img/yalorAuthor.jpeg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"liquidDemocracy","title":"Liquid Democracy\u2026What That?!?","author":"Yalor","author_image_url":"/img/yalorAuthor.jpeg"},"prevItem":{"title":"How Decentralized Giving could have helped (and will help) increase Transparency and avoid Cases like Oxfam\u2019s Scandal","permalink":"/es/blog/decentralizedGiving"},"nextItem":{"title":"What is the Future of Giving?","permalink":"/es/blog/futureOfGiving2017"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\'\\nimport styles from \'../src/css/custom.css\'\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Liquid Democracy\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/liquidDemocracy.jpeg\')} />\\n\\nWelcome to the future of voting.\\n\\nOr as some would say the Land of Possibilities :-)\\n\\n### So what IS liquid democracy?\\n\\nIn addition to being simply a system of tokenized voting you can think of it as a hybrid between representative and direct democracy.\\n\\nInstead of one person casting one vote, the system can become fractional. One vote can now be split in any number of ways between multiple delegates or sent entirely to your chosen delegate, and your delegate can delegate to someone else. Much delegation, so democracy.\\n\\nAs an example take a busy college student who just doesn\u2019t have time to vote, she could delegate \xbd her vote to her mom and \xbd her vote to her professor. If either of them wanted they could allocate a portion of the vote or all of it to a popular politically active persona that acts as a representative for the local community and controls an influential % of the total vote.\\n\\n\\nGiveth is a perfect playground for implementing liquid democracy\\n================================================================\\n\\nOf course, the reason we\u2019re explaining liquid democracy is because it is one of the core technologies that inspired Giveth\u2019s [Liquid Pledging](https://github.com/Giveth/liquidpledging) system, and we see it as an important building block for the governance of [DACs](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4).\\n\\nWhile there is no voting inherent in Giveth\u2019s base layer, there is an opportunity to use a governance system like liquid democracy in the various roles that are filled currently by people such as [Delegates or Reviewers](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4). This would mean that that a delegate, instead of being one person, would become a smart contract that has liquid democracy built in so that the donors can elect several delegates to decide which projects get funded (we will likely use a \u201cliquid plutocracy\u201d model, the more you donate the more votes you get).\\n\\nBut wait there\u2019s more, with liquid democracy + blockchain you have the ability to actually codify your vote.\\n\\nYes, I know, code what?\\n\\nCodifying your vote could allow you to tag different delegates to represent you based on the subject matter for the initiative. This means that if one initiative has an economic tag your vote for that initiative would be automatically allocated to the delegate you want to represent you on the economic issues, if another initiative carries the environmental tag your vote would be automatically allocated to your environmental delegate. Very diverse, much effective.\\n\\nSay an important issue comes up that you feel very strongly about. You can push a button and take your voting back and vote yourself, then push a button and put your delegation settings back the way they were.\\n\\nYou set the term limits, you can delegate for 20 seconds or 20 years!\\n\\nLiquid democracy gives everybody the ability to delegate their vote accordingly or even to overstep the position of their representative keeping them accountable for their actions on a day to day spectrum instead of year to year.\\n\\nNo one knows exactly what the future of voting looks like, but with Giveth we can start experimenting with this incredible model while making the world a better place at the same time! Much vast, many possibility, sooo future!\\n\\n[Democracy 3.0 For The Transparent World](https://medium.com/decentfund/democracy-3-0-for-the-transparent-world-5a9f1ffad1ad)\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Updated 11/20 ) Excellent article by [Igor Line](https://medium.com/u/bc1f295769e2?source=post_page-----bd3c63e8df52--------------------------------) on the varied benefits of Liquid Democracy.\\n\\nTo find out more about liquid democracy and how you can experiment within Giveth:\\n\\n*   Join us on [Riot or Slack](http://join.giveth.io)\\n*   Discover our [Site](http://giveth.io/) and [Wiki](https://wiki.giveth.io/)\\n*   Fork our code on [Github](http://github.com/Giveth/)\\n*   Follow us on [Medium](http://medium.com/giveth/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/givethio), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/givethio) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/)"},{"id":"futureOfGiving2017","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/futureOfGiving2017","source":"@site/blog/2017-10-26-futureofGiving2017.md","title":"What is the Future of Giving?","description":"Edit: for the current status of the development, more recent updates here","date":"2017-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"26 de octubre de 2017","tags":[],"readingTime":6.025,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kris","imageURL":"/img/krisAuthor.jpeg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"futureOfGiving2017","title":"What is the Future of Giving?","author":"Kris","author_image_url":"/img/krisAuthor.jpeg"},"prevItem":{"title":"Liquid Democracy\u2026What That?!?","permalink":"/es/blog/liquidDemocracy"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\'\\nimport styles from \'../src/css/custom.css\'\\n\\n\\n\\n_Edit: for the current status of the development, more recent updates_ [_here_](https://medium.com/giveth/tagged/dappening)\\n\\nIf you ever talked to a Giveth [Unicorn](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4) chances are high we did not let you go before you understood what Giveth is all about \u2014 we\u2019re a passionate bunch. If you haven\u2019t met people like [Griff Green](https://medium.com/@thegrifft), [Jordi Baylina](https://github.com/jbaylina), [Grace Torrellas](https://twitter.com/GraceTorrellas), [Vojtech Simetka](https://github.com/vojtechsimetka) and the [many other great faces](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/team-organisation/) contributing to the Giveth Platform you might wonder **what it is exactly we\u2019re building and why.**\\n\\nTo put it plain and simple: we want to make the **process of giving to causes you believe in effective and transparent**, and we are using blockchain technology to do so. In [October 2016](https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787) the team started developing the DApp (Donation Application) and is now [coming closer](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp) to the release of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In the build-up to this, we would like to take a moment to explain why we are creating the platform and give you a sneak peak of the user flow.\\n\\n**Wait, but why?**\\n\\nIf you have ever donated to non-profits or charitable organizations chances are high your experience was similar to this one: on your way to the metro you got stopped by a convincing youth who got your name, mailing address and signature for a fixed monthly donation to a specific cause. Since that moment, a few times per year \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky \u2014 you receive an old-school newsletter which you throw away without reading. **You are left entirely in the dark about where your donation went,** and the non-profit receives a monthly amount until you decide to cancel.\\n\\n\\nGiveth changes all this. As all donations are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain you can follow, in real-time, who gets your donations and why at a very granular level.\\n\\nThe Giveth platform has a simple result-based incentive structure: when funds are collected they are stored in our [Vault](https://medium.com/giveth/the-vault-contract-open-sourced-by-giveth-fe2261f7b91b) and only after Milestones are completed, can the funds be withdrawn. The Giver\u2019s funds are under their control until their donations are locked for a specific purpose.\\n\\nThis basic structure gives them a clear view on the various people involved in the process and the possibility to contact everyone directly. And if they don\u2019t like what their funds are intended to be used for, they have time to block its use.\\n\\nWe are building the **Future of Giving by cutting out the bureaucracy** so that funds can be spent more efficiently and everyone can collaborate in making the world a better place.\\n\\n**Talk the Talk**\\n\\nWe are re-engineering how donations are made, and with it, we had to reinvent the [language](http://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition) to talk about it. The 3 key building blocks of the Giveth system are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones. A **DAC** \u2014 short for Decentralized Altruistic Community \u2014 is the group of people united around a cause they want to support. This DAC will fund and steer multiple **Campaigns**, which can in their turn also be supported by more than one DAC. A Campaign translates the dreams of a DAC into a more specific agenda to which action points are linked: we call these the **Milestones**. Milestones are the smallest entity within the Giveth system and are the last step in our donation flow. Once completed, the funds are released into the wild to reimburse and reward good people for their good work.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Building Blocks of Giveth\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/buildingBlocksGiveth.png\')} />\\n\\n##### The 3 key building blocks of Giveth are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones.\\n\\nWe focus on the technology so people can focus entirely on uniting around causes. In order to do so, we need to define **some of the basic roles** in our system.\\n\\nA **Giver** can donate directly to a Campaign they believe in, or can decide to pledge funds to a DAC that will allocate these funds to appropriate Campaigns in the Giver\u2019s name \u2014 we call this process [Liquid pledging](https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52). By donating, the Giver automatically becomes part of the DAC and is connected with the rest of the community.\\n\\nThe **Delegates** are registered DAC members that take on the task of allocating funds sent to their DAC to one or more Campaigns.\\n\\nThe **Makers** are all the people within these campaigns making the change the DACs want to see in the world. There are a few specific roles the Makers have to fulfill.\\n\\n*   The **Campaign Managers** are the Makers that create Campaigns, assign funds to specific Milestones and make sure their specific Campaign is a success.\\n*   The **Milestone Managers** are the Makers in charge of specific Milestones and need to assure these very specific actions are achieved as described.\\n*   The **Recipients** are the Makers that receive the funds when a Milestone is successfully completed.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Giveth Roles\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/givingBlogRoles1.png\')} />\\n\\n##### Main roles within the Giveth Platform: Giver, Delegate, Campaign Manager, Milestone Manager, Recipient.\\n\\nTwo additional roles have been created to **guarantee the correct usage of funds**.\\n\\n*   The **Campaign Reviewer** can reject completion of any Milestone and can, as a strong security measure, even cancel a whole Campaign if it appears to be fraudulent.\\n*   The **Milestone Reviewer**\u2019s role is to confirm the Milestone Manager really achieved the proposed goal or action described in the Milestone.\\n\\nThis brings us to the **true power** of the Giveth platform: at all times the Giver knows exactly what is happening to the donated funds, how these are being spent and is in full control through a **transparent network of accountabilities**. If a Milestone is canceled, the funds are returned to the Campaign. If a Campaign is canceled, the funds are automatically returned to the Delegates that supported it. If a Delegate quits, the funds are returned to the Giver. On top of this, one of the most revolutionary aspects of this system is that at any point up until the moment funds are locked into a Campaign, the Giver can decide to withdraw them.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Giveth Additonal Roles\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'img/blog/givingBlogRoles2.png\')} />\\n\\n##### Two extra roles guarantee the correct usage of funds: Campaign Reviewer and Milestone Reviewer.\\n\\nYou can discover more about these roles and responsibilities by reading on in [the product definition](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/) on our wiki.\\n\\n**Walk the Walk**\\n\\nThe Giveth Donation Application is [now in beta stage on testnet](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp), with all of the roles described above integrated, and currently undergoing testing with a select team of volunteers.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPXoEzuNQzc\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n##### Giveth co-founder Griff Green explains what the Giveth Donation Application is about.\\n\\nWe always have opportunities for skilled developers to contribute to our project, and you can [donate](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/finances/) to \\\\`revolution.eth\\\\` to reward and incentivize the devs that are making the Giveth platform a reality.
